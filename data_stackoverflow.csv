78362944_Govy4.png,78362944,Govy4,78363049,"PRI * HTTP/2.0

SM


The block above is the client preface that the client sends to the server.
It looks like an HTTP/1.1 request, but with a special method PRI, no headers and some content (but no Content-Length).
It has been designed in this way for the reasons explained in the specification, see here.
Without the actual details of the Wireshark capture, it is difficult to say, but my guess is that you get back a 500 response because the server does not support HTTP/2, before the client has a chance to actually send the HTTP/2 request.
Or perhaps the HTTP/2 request is sent, but it's not decoded properly by Wireshark -- apparently the client does not send the required SETTINGS frame after the client preface (a guess from the last line of the capture).
Bottom line, the capture shows the preface bytes sent by the client, and it may be that you don't see the request because the client waits for the server to acknowledge that it can speak HTTP/2; however, it receives an HTTP/1.1 response instead, so the client does not even bother sending the HTTP/2 request.
This looks to me a legit behavior for a client.
You are trying to make a prior knowledge HTTP/2 request to a server that does not speak HTTP/2, so you must expect errors, including the fact that the request is not sent because the client figures the server does not speak HTTP/2, or the fact that the Wireshark decoder is not able to decode the request because perhaps the requires SETTINGS frame is missing, etc.
",,78362944_Govy4,"I ran into a problem and after trying a lot of different things, I didn't know where to turn and just decided to ask the problem here.
I am experimenting with API Injection for a Cybersecurity Project and ran into a problem which I can not manage to fix on my own.
As already mentioned in the topic, I am trying to capture traffic with wireshark and I was testing it out on a Python HTTP Server which I simply launched with python3 -m http.server.
When I try requesting this HTTP Server, with curl (curl http://localhost:8000 (yes, the port is correct)), I get the request and the response in wireshark. (See picture 1 below).
However when I try to request it with giving the flag --http2-prior-knowledge I can only see the response, and never the request. I am aware that the python server does not use http2 and that this causes an 50x error, however its weird that I see the response and not the request 
(Response is packet 21.) (Dont mind the port 7777 traffic that comes from a 5g service that I am hosting over this VM).
This is the response:

I dont get it. I see the request but not the response. I think that the reason is the http2 prior knowledge, but I want to know howI can actually see the request in the wireshark capture. I only see the 7777 Port activity (which is NRF for 5G), but not the request to 8000, which is where my http server is located. Help is very much appreciated and I hope the situation is understandable even though my frustration.
EDIT:
The original reason why I want to capture traffic is so that I can query an API Endpoint to get 5G Network Functions. The code I run in the cli is: curl -H ""Accept: application/json"" -X GET --http2-prior-knowledge 'http://127.0.0.10:7777/nnrf-nfm/v1/nf-instances' and I get back a response like: {""_links"":{""items"":[{""href"":""http://127.0.0.10:7777/nnrf-nfm/v1/nf-instances/d39729b0-fd9f-41ee-aea6-e94a977477e0""},{""h...
I know its working fine, because that is the response I am expecting.
However back in wireshark it is the same story again.wireshark overview response
I have the response from Packet 1-20. And this is a specific endpoint out of multiple ones, which I tested and got back different responses, with again not capturing the get request.
Do you maybe have any Idea what the reason could be?

77138141_xpMz0.png,77138141,xpMz0,77138158,"You need to update num after each calculation to reduce its amount by the value of the coins you just calculated, so that the next calculation is done on the adjusted amount that is left over.
With the way you are doing it right now, you are calculating the number of nickels and pennies that are in the original amount, not in the adjusted amount, which is why you are getting the wrong results.
IOW, after you calculated the number of quarters, you ignored the value of the quarters when calculating the number of dimes, but you did not subsequently ignore the value of the dimes before calculating the number of nickels, or ignore the value of the nickels before calculating the number of pennies.
Try this instead:
q = num / 25;
num %= 25; // <-- add this!
cout << ""The number of quarters: "" << q << endl;
d = num / 10;
num %= 10; // <-- add this!
cout << ""The number of dimes: "" << d << endl;
n = num / 5;
num %= 5; // <-- add this!

In order to get a reference to elements inside a shadow dom you need to get a reference to the shadowRoot property first and query from there. For example if there was a shadow root on the <body> you would need to do

However, from the exception stack we can derive 2 areas of issue:

java.lang.NullPointerException is due to an issue in the following method

com.tests.marguerite.utils.TearDown.quitDriver(TearDown.java:22)
as noted in line 22 - One of the objects being accessed on that line is probably null, it might be trying to perform an operation on a WebDriver instance that has not been initialized or has already been disposed of


NoClassDefFoundError

a necessary dependency is missing from the project, in this case it is in relation to the HasFederatedCredentialManagement class
there is an issue with the Selenium dependencies
the aforementioned class is implemented by ChromeDriver, ChromiumDriver, EdgeDriver, FirefoxDriver,RemoteWebDriver and SafariDriver



Looking at the dependency properties from your pom, you have the following:

<selenium.version>4.11.0<selenium.version>
<seleniumclient.version>4.8.1<seleniumclient.version>

Synchronize Versions: It's generally a good practice to keep the versions of related libraries synchronized to avoid any compatibility issues. Update either selenium.version or seleniumclient.version to match the other, preferably to the latest stable version, if that doesn't introduce other problems.
These more than likely have to match in version, as each dependency more than likely is reliant on a transitive dependency with the same version.
Update the following:
<seleniumclient.version>4.8.1<seleniumclient.version>
to
<seleniumclient.version>4.11.0<seleniumclient.version>

Also please note for future questions the following:

How to create a Minimal, Reproducible Example
Minimal: Use as little code as possible that still produces the same problem
Complete: Provide all parts someone else needs to reproduce your problem in the question itself
Reproducible: Test the code you're about to provide to make sure it reproduces the problem
DO NOT use images of code. Copy the actual text from your code editor, paste it into the question, then format it as code.

77416440_vGyA8.png,77416440,vGyA8,77416501,"OK, the problem is in initialization and in for map loop.
The solution


// create hook like this
const [listOfRestuarants, setListOfRestuarants] = useState(mockData.restuarants);



in JSX use the below code


// create hook like this
listOfRestuarants.map((card) => (<Restuarant key={card.id} restData={card} />))



This will solve your problem.
The actual problem is in initialization where you are setting up an object but when you click on the button you are applying the filter which returns the array.

It takes each restaurant and sends to restaurantCard component and it renders perfectly, but the issue arises when I click the button.

It's also worthwhile to point out, per this answer and the specification, that:

If you have not set an explicit height to the containing block (and
the child is not absolutely positioned), then your child element with
percentage height will have nothing to go on and height will be
determined by content and other properties.

I got this error :

It looks like this:

Why have I got this error and how it can be fixed ?
ADDITIVE INFO :
I recreated a database with utf8mb4_unicode_ci collation :

Next I check procedure code  :

I recreated the procedure with set @@local.collation_server parameter:
DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS sp_getFilteredProductsWithDiscounts;

set @@local.collation_server = utf8mb4_unicode_ci;

create definer = lardev@localhost procedure sp_getFilteredProductsWithDiscounts(IN in_status varchar(1), IN in_discountPriceAllowed tinyint unsigned, IN in_in_stock varchar(1), IN in_stock_qty mediumint, IN in_discounts_qty mediumint)
BEGIN


SELECT products.id, products.title, products.sale_price,
    GROUP_CONCAT(CONCAT(discounts.name, ': ', discounts.min_qty, ': ', discounts.max_qty, ': ', discounts.percent)) AS discount_info
FROM products
    LEFT JOIN discount_product ON discount_product.product_id = products.id
    LEFT JOIN discounts on discounts.id = discount_product.discount_id
    WHERE ( products.status = in_status OR ISNULL(in_status) ) AND
      ( products.discount_price_allowed = in_discountPriceAllowed OR ISNULL(in_discountPriceAllowed)) AND
      ( products.in_stock = 1 OR ISNULL(in_in_stock) ) AND
      ( products.stock_qty >= in_stock_qty OR ISNULL(in_stock_qty) ) AND

    -- from 200 till 300
    GROUP BY products.id, products.title, products.sale_price
    COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci; -- I ADDED COLLATE IN REQUEST MANUALLY

END;

But anyway I got error :
SQL Error [1267] [HY000]: Illegal mix of collations (utf8mb4_unicode_ci,IMPLICIT) and (utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci,IMPLICIT) for operation '='

In both cases when I run command :

from phpstorm 2023 or dbeaver Version 23.2.2. Even after I added collate in request manually.
How to fix it ?

When you want to make a instance of a ""class""(public class ...)  by ""denpendency injection"" way , you will need to register the class to service.
It means when there's some code like below (using dependency injection) in your project:

        public xxxxxx(Context context)

The solution


// create hook like this
const [listOfRestuarants, setListOfRestuarants] = useState(mockData.restuarants);



in JSX use the below code


// create hook like this
listOfRestuarants.map((card) => (<Restuarant key={card.id} restData={card} />))



This will solve your problem.
The actual problem is in initialization where you are setting up an object but when you click on the button you are applying the filter which returns the array.

Every table was joined with the website_order table, except for the Brand table, It was joined with the facebook_adset table. And when i joined the Brand table with the website_order table.

What I think happened is, The drop-down list had elements from Brand from which the whole dashboard is to be filtered, and then it was joined with facebook_adset table which had no elements for that specific date.

Looking at the bottom left of your screenshot, you can see the list of tasks executed:

compileKotlin UP-TO-DATE: this means you changed no Kotlin code, so in 1s 410ms Gradle noticed no code needed to be compiled.
compileJava SKIPPED: the icon means the task was skipped. Most likely, it's because there is no Java code in your project.
processResources UP-TO-DATE: Gradle collects all files in src/main/resources and puts them in the final binary.
classes UP-TO-DATE: is a lifecycle task to group the previous ones.
…
bootRun: This task is running your application. It is not compilation. It's been running for 20min 57s, which means Gradle finished compiling ~21 minutes ago. Your application is running, it's not compiling anymore.

77238636_QMRhZ.png,77238636,QMRhZ,77249213,"I think i have found a suitable solution for my problem now. But I have separated the sorting into three steps:
First thing I did is to sort the answerValues by ID:
for (SrmQsRfiAnswer answer: laneValues.getAnswers()) {
    List <SrmQsRfiAnswerValue> answerValues = answer.getAnswerValues();
    answerValues.sort(Comparator.comparingLong(SrmQsRfiAnswerValue::getId));

Now all answerValues of every answer are sorted by ID. Then I put all answers to a HashMap with the answer ID as key.
Map <Long, List< SrmQsRfiAnswer>> answerMap = laneValues.getAnswers().stream()
    .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(SrmQsRfiAnswer::getId));

And in the final step, I sort the answers for each key in the Map by the lowest ID of the answerValues with a custom ""comparator"":
answerMap.values().forEach(listOfAnswers - > listOfAnswers.sort(Comparator.comparingLong(SrmQsRfiAnswer::getMinAnswerValueId)));

public class SrmQsRfiAnswer {
...
    public Long getMinAnswerValueId() {
        if (answerValues == null || answerValues.isEmpty()) {
            return Long.MAX_VALUE; // Return a high value for null or empty lists
        }
        return answerValues.stream()
            .mapToLong(SrmQsRfiAnswerValue::getId)
            .min()
            .orElse(Long.MAX_VALUE);
    }

What I would like to achieve is the following:

Traverse every answer and sort their answerValues by id ascending.
Sort answers by the smallest id of one of their answerValues.


What I've tried so far to address 2. is:
laneValues.setAnswers(laneValues.getAnswers().stream()
                    .sorted((e1, e2) -> e1.getAnswerValues().get(0).getId().compareTo(e2.getAnswerValues().get(0).getId())).toList());

Problem:

the .get(0) throws an NPE if answer has no answerValues.
Requires sorting the answerValues by their id for every answer first.

Here are the steps to do this in the console.
This is for the default exports:
const module = await import('./app.js');
const emmei = module.default;
console.log(emmei);


And for the named exports we do:
// Access named exports using destructuring
const { image, url } = module
console.log(image,url)

While debugging in Chrome DevTools, I encountered an issue. Initially, I attempted to directly access a variable named emmei for debugging purposes (as we usually do in the console for normal JS files without type=""module""), but encountered an error message. Realizing that ES6 modules have their own scope and do not add their variables to the global scope, I explored alternative approaches.
My next attempt was to import the variable first in the Developer console and then access it. So, I executed:
import emmei from './app.js';

in the DevTools console window but encountered another error.
My notion is that if I could somehow find the correct path to where the app.js has been loaded in the Chrome browser, then we can import our variables from this file.
Again I tried with import emmei from './Sources/app.js' but to no success.
QUESTION:
Given that ES6 modules have their own scope and don't add variables to the global scope, I'm now wondering if there's a way to find the correct path to import variables from ES6 modules in Chrome DevTools?



UPDATE
With help from Mr. @Bergi in the comment, we are able to get access to the Module (I believe a constructor) using this syntax in the DevTools console.
await import('./app.js')

We are very close now, Need to somehow be able to get our exported variables from the app.js now.
I tried with .then() [since await (async function returns promise)], but not yet able to get the variable extracted.
Any ideas to share here?

The most important implication of how Tailwind extracts class names is that it will only find classes that exist as complete unbroken strings in your source files.
If you use string interpolation or concatenate partial class names together, Tailwind will not find them and therefore will not generate the corresponding CSS:
Don’t construct class names dynamically
<div class=""text-{{ error ? 'red' : 'green' }}-600""></div>

In the example above, the strings text-red-600 and text-green-600 do not exist, so Tailwind will not generate those classes.
Instead, make sure any class names you’re using exist in full:
Always use complete class names
<div class=""{{ error ? 'text-red-600' : 'text-green-600' }}""></div>


Thus, with regards to the error, Tailwind interprets the class bg-[url('${image.node.sourceUrl}')] literally:
.bg-\[url\(\$\{image\.node\.sourceUrl\}\)\] {
  background-image: url(${image.node.sourceUrl});
}

and as the error suggests, Next cannot find this file named ${image.node.sourceUrl} literally.
To work around this, consider using the style attribute:
<div … style={{ backgroundImage: `url('${image.node.sourceUrl}')` }}>

",,78313521_obXa0,"I have a component that gets data from Advance Custom Fields from a WordPress CMS. The component then receives an image, then the image is added as a background image on the div.
This is the component:
const Hero = ({ content, ...rest}) => {
const { addImage, image, imagePosition } = content

const backgroundImageClass = twMerge(
    className({
        [`bg-[url('${image.node.sourceUrl}')] bg-cover rounded-[2.5rem] px-5 md:px-[6.75] my-10`]: addImage && imagePosition[0] == 'back'

    rest.className
)

return(
    <div className={`grid grid-cols-12 py-20 ${backgroundImageClass}`}>
        ...

}
Using the Classnames package I validate if I should add the image, and if the image goes on the background. Then I concatenate the image URL into the Tailwind class.
When I do this, I get this error message

I try to debug this but I can't find the issue.
I used the external URL as a string on the Tailwind class and it works.
I checked the CSS output when I concatenate the image URL variable and it looks ok, this is the output:
.bg-\[url\(\'http\:\/\/anyness-cms\.local\/wpcontent\/uploads\/2024\/04\/dylan\.png\'\)\] {

Looking at the dependency properties from your pom, you have the following:

Synchronize Versions: It's generally a good practice to keep the versions of related libraries synchronized to avoid any compatibility issues. Update either selenium.version or seleniumclient.version to match the other, preferably to the latest stable version, if that doesn't introduce other problems.
These more than likely have to match in version, as each dependency more than likely is reliant on a transitive dependency with the same version.

78673647_lGcu2ov9.png,78673647,lGcu2ov9,78680045,"I must not have been keeping good track of which possible solution I was trying... I think I may have mix and mashed them, which resulted in the cookies not being stored.
Ultimately I had domain="".localhost"" in my SessionMiddleware, like so:
app.add_middleware(
    SessionMiddleware,
    secret_key=SECRET_KEY,
    https_only=True,
    max_age=3600,  # 3600s = 1hr, the life of spotify access token
    same_site=""none"",
    domain="".localhost""   # THIS WAS WHAT WAS KILLING ME
)

This was a suggestion I had seen online, but that must have been when I was serving my frontend on localhost and not 127.0.0.1.
Now that both my backend and frontend are being served on 127.0.0.1, I recognized this faulty domain specification and removed it. The backend session middleware now correctly sends cookies to the default domain (that of the backend, 127.0.0.1) and my cookies are being correctly stored!!
Still have to confirm that I can actually use the session cookies as intended in my other API endpoints, but I'll just enjoy the moment and worry about that tomorrow :)
Thanks for the comments/suggestions!
",,78673647_lGcu2ov9,"I have a fullstack app made up of a React frontend and a FastAPI (python) backend, both of which are currently being served locally on 127.0.0.1 (localhost).
BACKEND:
Here is the code for my backend server, with CORSMiddleware and SessionMiddleware configured:
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, status, Request
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from starlette.middleware.sessions import SessionMiddleware
import spotipy
from spotipy.oauth2 import SpotifyOAuth

CLIENT_ID = ""YYYY""
CLIENT_SECRET = ""ZZZ""
OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI = ""http://127.0.0.1:3000/""
SCOPE = ""playlist-read-private playlist-read-collaborative user-read-private user-read-email""

# Docs: https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.24.0/#module-spotipy.oauth2
sp_oauth = SpotifyOAuth(client_id=CLIENT_ID, client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET, redirect_uri=OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI, scope=SCOPE)

@app.post(""/spotify-auth"", tags=[""auth""])
def exchange_token(code: str, request: Request):
    # Exchanges token, with check_cache=False to ensure new users can be registered
    token_info = sp_oauth.get_access_token(code=code, check_cache=False)
    print(token_info)
    # https://www.starlette.io/middleware/#sessionmiddleware
    request.session[""access_token""] = token_info[""access_token""]
    request.session[""refresh_token""] = token_info[""refresh_token""]
    return {""tokenSaved"": True}

In other endpoints, i.e. /user, when I try to access request.session.get(""access_token""), I get absolutely nothing back.
FRONTEND:
here is the axios POST request from my frontend (react/typescript) that will hit the /spotify-auth endpoint on my backend:
const exchangeSpotifyAuthToken = async (
    code: string,
): Promise<AccessTokenReponse> => {
    const searchParams = new URLSearchParams();
    searchParams.append(""code"", code);
    const response = await axios.post(
        `${API_URL_BASE}/spotify-auth?` + searchParams.toString(),
        { withCredentials: true },
    );
    return response.data;
};

But as I said, my attempts to use the access_token in other routes, which should be accessible via request.session.get(""access_token"") all fail. Each of my axios requests also include this { withCredentials: true } config, so that shouldn't be the problem.
THINGS I'VE TRIED:
I've seen a lot of CORS related posts regarding this issue, and I think I have implemented the requirements as follows:

CORSMiddleware allowed origins on backend configured to receive requests from my frontend (127.0.0.1:3000)
allow_credentials=True on backend
Frontend and backend located at same domain: 127.0.0.1
requests from frontend configured with withCredentials: true

BROWSER TOOLS:
I also checked the browser tools Network tab and saw that my session was being correctly recorded following my POST request to login/authenticate:

But any followup requests to my backend do not contain this session cookie, so they promptly fail my authentication check:

Shouldn't my session cookie show up in those request headers so that my backend can retrieve them? What am I doing wrong?
Thanks!

77268448_35ObG.png,77268448,35ObG,77270850,"As Konrad mentioned, the issue on your side comes from the wrong usage of the  tag.
It should includes a src attribute, but the attribute is not properly set. Instead, the src attribute is surrounded by the opening and closing script tags, which is not a valid way to include an external JavaScript file.
In this incorrect code you showed, the entire <script> src=""script2.js""</script> will be treated as plain text content within the HTML document. It will not be recognized as an external JavaScript file reference, and the content inside script2.js will not be executed as JavaScript.
To properly include an external JavaScript file, you should use the correct syntax, as follows:
<script src=""script2.js""></script>

What I am expecting to see is a ""Live"" console (console.log) readout (in the CONSOLE tab) of the result of my code when I do a SAVE in VS Code, but this is not happening. I can see my .js file and .html files in the SOURCES tab and they update dynamically as I make changes in VS Code, so something is working, just not the console.
I have tried this with Chrome Canary, Firefox Developer Edition and Edge, on both MAC and Windows 10 and the result is always the same - the console doesn't display anything. Since this is failing on every browser and operating system I try, my sense is that I'm missing something fundamental.
To be clear, Live Server is working perfectly except for the console. Perhaps it's something in my environment.

77457552_CzMBl.png,77457552,CzMBl,77457567,"This is because, when using docker-compose, DNS resolves the name of your services (your services are main and redis as declared in your docker-compose file). When you enter redis:6379, it will automatically resolve to redis_container_ip_inside_network:6379.
Notice how you are declaring the service name in the compose file. Where are you declaring it when you're not using compose? Hint: you aren't, and this is why, when you use docker run, the container just doesn't know what redis:6379 means.
Instead of using redis:6379 as the redis endpoint, you will need to use redis_container_ip_inside_network:6379. You can assign the IP yourself so that it is always predictable by using the --ip parameter. Make sure the IP can be assigned to your docker network subnet (which you can also specify when creating the network with the --subnet parameter).
You can find your container IP addresses inside the network with the docker network inspect backend command when your containers are running.
",,77457552_CzMBl,"I was trying to run main server image and redis
So I follow below process

docker network create --bridge backend
docker run -d --network backend -p 6379:6379 ""redis alpine image""
docker run -d --network backend -p 8080:8080 ""main server image""

And I tried to POST to server using postman 
But server return 500

And when I see the log, it says because it cant connect with redis

but when using

docker compose up -d redis
docker compose up -d main

it works well

my docker compose yml is below like
version: ""3.7""

services:
  main:
    image : ${REPO_URL}/${ECR_REPOSITORY}:${IMAGE_TAG}

      - 8080:8080

  redis:

      - 6379:6379

      - backend


networks:
  backend:

docker compose up and docker run work different internally?

I recently upgraded my Visual Studio to version 17.8.0, I think I was at 17.6.2 before. In this new version, when I type prop tab or cw tab Visual Studio triple indents the line. See my figures below:


As you can see, MyProperty gets triple indented when I hit tab. I tried looking how to fix this and people said to adjust my tab settings, but as far as I can tell they look fine?

It worked both when i wanted to execute part of the code as well as when cursor was simply in the line that interested me.
However, very recently I've noticed that the same shortcut jumps to the next fragment of code, which I REALLY hate.
I'd appreciate any tips on how to disable jumping to the next line when executing lines.

I've figured that it might be related to the keybinding in settings, so I've deleted all of them but the highlighted one - still jumps to next line.
When I delete highlited line, it stops working altohether. I'm not use how to remove ""jump to next line after execution"" behaviour.
I've tried using custom macro
""macros"": {
    ""pythonRunCurrentLineAndStay"": [

78653532_LR3UEHEd.png,78653532,LR3UEHEd,78653573,"""Move"" in many languages (not just Rust) is a semantic term that refers to transfer of ownership and does not necessarily dictate a mechanism for that transfer.  In Rust, moving a value copies the data somewhere else, but leaves the source of the value unusable (unless that source is later reinitialized with a valid value, or the type being moved implements Copy).
How this is implemented in Rust is with a bitwise copy from the source value to the destination.  At higher optimization levels, this copy can be elided, but may not be.
Note that the copy only extends to the values contained directly within the value being moved.  For example, when moving a Vec this copies the data pointer, length, and capacity of the Vec but not the actual elements of the Vec, which are behind that pointer.  This allows you to move any Vec at the same cost -- moving a huge Vec and an empty Vec both require copying exactly the same amount of stuff (3 pointer-sized values).
In your code, taking the address of foo and bar is likely preventing the optimizer from actually eliding the copy, because it cannot unify their memory location.  Doing so and returning the same address for both variables would violate the as-if rule.
In other words:

If you are trying to see how code will compile, don't change that code to inspect values from inside of the code or you will almost certainly change the optimizer's behavior in some way.  Instead, look at the generated machine code.

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Foo {
    name: i32,
    age: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let foo = Foo { name: 111, age: 1 };

    let ptr_foo = std::ptr::addr_of!(foo);
    println!(""Address of foo: {:p}"", ptr_foo);

    let bar = foo;

    let ptr_bar = std::ptr::addr_of!(bar);
    println!(""Address of bar: {:p}"", ptr_bar);
}

I initially thought that ""there's a variable foo, and after a move, we simply renamed it to bar"", thereby avoiding the need to copy its corresponding data.
To investigate further, I used the debug functionality in VSCode with a plugin called ""Hex Editor"" and found that both foo and bar ( memory addresses 0x7fffffffd7d8 and 0x7fffffffd828), containing identical data (6F 00 00 00 01 00 00 00).

Does this indicate that Rust actually performs a copy operation even during a move, such as copying a struct in this case? Could this behavior vary depending on whether it's in release mode?

The first step is to download the sample application to your own machine so you can look at Dockerfile or docker-compose and understand how to use Docker. If you do not have git installed on your machine you should do so, then use git clone command to clone the sample application repository to your machine. Check out git documentation if you are not familiar: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone

With the sample application installed, you should see Dockerfile and docker-compose inside the project directory.

Docker layers and images are stored at C:\ProgramData\docker. Check out this page for more detailed information: https://github.com/docker/getting-started-app

You can create docker projects everywhere, the commands connect to the Docker engine with api and create the images/containers in its own file system. See for more info: https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/#docker-architecture

Does Docker Desktop require that I install git separately, or is it included?

Secondly, it assumes I know where to find the Dockerfile.
I have no idea where it is - where is it?

Thirdly, if I pull an image down using Docker Desktop, where does it store the image/files locally? If I run this command in the CLI, do I need to be in a DOS/PS prompt, or do I need to run it from within the WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) shell? And what directory should I be in when I run it?

Fourthly, where is the compose.yaml file located?

Fifthly, do Docker project folders need to be located somewhere specifically relative to the Docker Desktop application itself for docker commands to work properly, or can I create Docker project folders anywhere that suits my folder management scheme?

If you use convert, you need to supply both an input filename and an output filename in the format convert INPUT -gravity ... -crop ... OUTPUT. If you use mogrify it modifies the file in place, so you only need a single filename. You appear to have used convert with one filename which will not work.

You are using -execdir rather than -exec. I do not know why. The difference is that execdir changes directory to the directory containing the file prior to running your command - this appears unnecessary in your case.


So, I think you need to use a command more like the following:
find . -type f -name ""com.plexapp.agents.localmedia_*"" -exec mogrify -gravity center -crop 1:1 {} \;

Or, if you really want to use convert:
find . -type f -name ""com.plexapp.agents.localmedia_*"" -exec convert {} -gravity center -crop 1:1 {} \;

How can I do it from the terminal to crop the pictures in with an aspect ratio of 1:1 without stretching the images or scaling them?
I will do a backup in case the edit break the program.

    static const char* FILES2[2] = {

The way you have GetSoundCategory() coded, main() has no way of knowing how many strings are actually in the returned array.  So, when category == 2, it's loop ends up going out of bounds since there are only 2 strings in the array but the loop iterates 3 times.
To solve this, you have a few options.  You can either:

null-terminate the arrays, eg:
const char** GetSoundCategory(int category)
{
    static const char* FILES1[4] = {
        ""/myfile1.mp3"",
        ""/this_is_my_file.mp3"",
        ""/myfile9.mp3"",
        nullptr
    };

    static const char* FILES2[3] = {
        ""/I love S.E.mp3"",
        ""/please_help_me.mp3"",
        nullptr
    };   

    ...
}

...

const char** files = GetSoundCategory(2);

for (int i = 0; files[i] != nullptr; i++)
{
    printf(""%s\n"", files[i]);
}


return the array length as well as the array pointer.  You can do that with an output parameter, eg:
const char** GetSoundCategory(int category, int *length)
{
    ...

    *length = ...;
    return ...;
}

...

int number_of_files;
const char** files = GetSoundCategory(2, &number_of_files);

Or, return a simple struct that holds both the array pointer and the array length, eg:
struct filesArray {
    const char** files;
    int number_of_files;
};

filesArray GetSoundCategory(int category)
{
    ...

    filesArray fa;
    fa.files = ...;
    fa.number_of_files = ...;

    return fa;
}

...

filesArray fa = GetSoundCategory(2);

for (int i = 0; i < fa.number_of_files; i++)
{
    printf(""%s\n"", fa.files[i]);
}






That being said, you really should ditch the old C-based idioms in your code and embrace more modern C++ idioms, like std::vector, std::array, std::string(_view), etc, eg:
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <array>
#include <string_view>

std::vector<std::string_view> GetSoundCategory(int category)
{
    static std::array<const char*, 3> FILES1 = {
        ""/myfile1.mp3"",
        ""/this_is_my_file.mp3"",
        ""/myfile9.mp3""
    };

    static std::array<const char*, 2> FILES2 = {
        ""/I love S.E.mp3"",
        ""/please_help_me.mp3""
    };   

    switch (category)
    {
        case 1:
            return {FILES1.begin(), FILES1.end()};
        case 2:
            return {FILES2.begin(), FILES2.end()};
    }

    return {};
}

int main()
{
    auto files = GetSoundCategory(2);

    for (auto file : files)
    {
        std::cout << file << std::endl;
    }
}

The following is a mockup of what I'm trying to do. I have a method which a value is passed in, and based on that value I want to return a different hard-coded array of strings.
When I step through this, my function in main() seems to work, and it looks like I'm returning the proper type in the function. I can set a breakpoint and see files[0] is the expected string, files[1] is the expected string, etc. I can step through the loop and set a watch for files[i] and I see the appropriate string. All is good there.
So two questions: How do I get how many elements are in the array? From reading a million posts, it seems like I'm not able to do this, right? Do I just need some end string (empty string, for example) that I need to check through as I loop through?
Second, you'll notice I have the printf() commented out. When I had that enabled, after stepping through the printf(), it would change the contents of the string, and I don't understand why it's doing that. See images for the before/after of the step-through and the result of the watches. I thought it might be because the strings aren't implicitly terminated with a \0, but that had no effect.

78429662_BHFIUxAz.png,78429662,BHFIUxAz,78429703,"Per:
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-syntax-lexical.html#SQL-SYNTAX-IDENTIFIERS

SQL identifiers and key words must begin with a letter (a-z, but also letters with diacritical marks and non-Latin letters) or an underscore (_). Subsequent characters in an identifier or key word can be letters, underscores, digits (0-9), or dollar signs ($). Note that dollar signs are not allowed in identifiers according to the letter of the SQL standard, so their use might render applications less portable. The SQL standard will not define a key word that contains digits or starts or ends with an underscore, so identifiers of this form are safe against possible conflict with future extensions of the standard.

Further down:

There is a second kind of identifier: the delimited identifier or quoted identifier. It is formed by enclosing an arbitrary sequence of characters in double-quotes (""). A delimited identifier is always an identifier, never a key word. So ""select"" could be used to refer to a column or table named “select”, whereas an unquoted select would be taken as a key word and would therefore provoke a parse error when used where a table or column name is expected. The example can be written with quoted identifiers like this:


UPDATE ""my_table"" SET ""a"" = 5;


Quoted identifiers can contain any character, except the character with code zero. (To include a double quote, write two double quotes.) This allows constructing table or column names that would otherwise not be possible, such as ones containing spaces or ampersands. The length limitation still applies.

If you actually have a table named todo-list then it needs to double quoted when creating it and referring to it:

create table ""todo-list""(id integer);

select * from ""todo-list"";
 id 
----
(0 rows)

--Versus what you are seeing.
select * from todo-list;
ERROR:  syntax error at or near ""-""


I would stick with _ and eliminate the whole double quoting issue.

Every table was joined with the website_order table, except for the Brand table, It was joined with the facebook_adset table. And when i joined the Brand table with the website_order table.

What I think happened is, The drop-down list had elements from Brand from which the whole dashboard is to be filtered, and then it was joined with facebook_adset table which had no elements for that specific date.

While attempting to create a new package to isolate the issues I was facing in an existing package, I encountered an error related to Android embedding v2 during the creation of the new package.
Upon researching this, I came across an existing issue at this link: link. If you take a look at the link, you might get a better understanding of the problem.
In essence, there seems to be an issue related to the Flutter-pub side of things. Naturally, I followed the package creation process using the command
flutter create -t package test --no-pub

, and I transferred the package dependencies and contents to the new one I created using this command.
The result: I can now write and execute unit tests without any issue.
To summarize, if you created a package before version 3.0 and then try to use it on a system with Flutter 3.0 installed, you might encounter errors due to package dependencies. You can overcome this problem by creating a new package using the mentioned command and transferring the necessary files.
By the way, I found the command from this comment: link.

Furthermore, if I directly write the enum and its extension into the test file instead of importing them, and then remove the imports, I can run the test file without encountering any errors. However, even though the imported files don't contains any export lines, why might I still be receiving an unrelated error?

78366032_B2vSB.png,78366032,B2vSB,78366751,"Answer:.Decode(&doc)→ Decoding Makes Body Empty
This issue arises because when you read from http.Request.Body, which is an io.ReadCloser, the data is consumed and is not available for subsequent reads. Apparently, this is a common mistake, especially when multiple handlers or middleware need to access the request body.
To fix this, you need to read the entire body first, and then restore it so that it can be re-read by subsequent handlers or middleware. Here’s the essential piece of code that accomplishes this:
// Read the entire body
bodyBytes, err := io.ReadAll(r.Body)
if err != nil {
    http.Error(w, ""Error reading request body"", http.StatusInternalServerError)
    return
}
// Restore the io.ReadCloser to its original state
r.Body = io.NopCloser(bytes.NewBuffer(bodyBytes))

//code continues...
// Read and decode the request body into a generic map to determine the type of document
var doc map[string]interface{} //...


Explanation:

Consuming the Body: The json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&doc) operation reads the entire contents of the io.ReadCloser stream. Once read, the stream is empty because io.ReadCloser does not support rewinding. This effectively ""consumes"" the body, making it empty for any subsequent attempts to read it.

Restoring the Body: After reading, r.Body is re-assigned using io.NopCloser(bytes.NewBuffer(bodyBytes)). This line creates a new io.ReadCloser from the bodyBytes we read earlier, effectively duplicating the original content. io.NopCloser is used to convert an io.Reader (returned by bytes.NewBuffer) into an io.ReadCloser without adding any functionality to close, as the buffer does not need to be closed.


This approach ensures that any middleware or handler that runs after this code will still have access to the full request body as if it were untouched.
Why This Is Important:
Not handling the request body correctly can lead to subtle bugs, especially in larger applications where multiple parts of the middleware chain may need to inspect or modify the request. This technique ensures that all parts of your HTTP server can operate correctly without interfering with each other.
",,78366032_B2vSB,"I'm developing a middleware in Go that intercepts HTTP requests, reads JSON data from the request body, and indexes it as a document in Elasticsearch based on this documentation.

Undefined array key ""appnamesubmit""
 
Undefined array key ""date""

Array to string conversion

This is my last step in getting my web-app completed. I just need to be able to submit the truck check form data to the mysql db table.

What am I doing wrong here? Should I specify the length of the array myself explicitly?
Also, the elements should be compatible with the DATE (div_t type). Will that still be the case if I work with std::array or std::vector?
Side note:
Yes I know this is not the best way of doing it, but yes there are 90000 lines of code in the program I work with, that already use this DATE structure and this array way of working with things. So just to add a few lines of code, I will not introduce vectors or get rid of the macros or invent another DATE type that is not compatible with the rest of the (indeed very questionable) code.

76989437_bFWjb.png,76989437,bFWjb,76989496,"Rather than using opacity, which applies evenly across the entire element, you should use a gradient mask.
The neatest way to superimpose a gradient on top of something is with an ::after pseudo-element. Your elements may not be in a specific container, but all elements are contained in the <body> element, so you could apply the gradient at that level. If you want the text to fade into the background, then make the gradient colour match the background colour, or if you want it all to fade to white, then make it a white gradient.


body {
  background-color: #e9dfba;
  position: relative;
}

body::after {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;

<div>Code line 8</div>
<div>Code line 9</div>
<div>Code line 10</div>



If there is really no container element you can use, and you only want to style the individual items, then you could just split the gradient into five and apply a section of it to each of the last five items.

  background-color: #e9dfba;

In this example, the ten .d1 <div>s are children of the <body>, but the last
child of the body is an empty <script> element. You can see this in your

I am sending an email using a C++ program through Gmail (smtp.gmail.com). However, I encounter some strange issues when sending emails to multiple recipients; only the first recipient receives the email.
Based on the communication log, Gmail's server accepts the email without returning any errors. The address format also complies with Gmail standards. Do you have any ideas or suggestions regarding this issue?


I expected that all recipients would receive the email.
I thought there might be null-terminated characters in between, so I tried looping through all the strings to ensure there were no null-terminated characters. However, I still encountered the same issues. I also attempted passing all recipients as a list, but the problem persisted.
Additionally, I verified that it's not a recipients issue by swapping the recipients’ email addresses, and the result remained the same. Only the first recipient received the email.

console.log(`Function result: ${someFunction()}`);

str = str + `<div class=""card my-4 mx-4"" style=""width: 20.5rem;"">\

76809354_XMooF.png,76809354,XMooF,76822954,"Issue fixed by using server site generation approach (SSG) in which we use generateStaticParams()
when ever we make dynamic routes ( the [id] page ) we need to use generateStaticParams() in that [id] page. this will tell next.js to render this as (SSG) not SSR Or CSR in build run time.
so by (SSG) next stores dynamic data as static and when user calls request or hits api next has already rendered and stored the dynamic data and immediatly gives user the requested data. this approach reduce latency by not hitting api for request as data is already rendered statictly and stored.

Realizing that ES6 modules have their own scope and do not add their variables to the global scope, I explored alternative approaches.
My next attempt was to import the variable first in the Developer console and then access it. So, I executed:
import emmei from './app.js';

in the DevTools console window but encountered another error.
My notion is that if I could somehow find the correct path to where the app.js has been loaded in the Chrome browser, then we can import our variables from this file.

Don’t construct class names dynamically
<div class=""text-{{ error ? 'red' : 'green' }}-600""></div>

In the example above, the strings text-red-600 and text-green-600 do not exist, so Tailwind will not generate those classes.
Instead, make sure any class names you’re using exist in full:
Always use complete class names
<div class=""{{ error ? 'text-red-600' : 'text-green-600' }}""></div>


You could look at using the style attribute instead like:
const App = () => {
  // …

  return (
    <div
      className=""w-[60vw] h-[100vh] mx-[20vw] flex justify-center items-center""
      style={{ backgroundColor: players[activePlayer] }}
    >
      <div
        className=""grid gap-2""
        style={{
          gridTemplateRows: `repeat(${gridSize}, 1fr)`,
          gridTemplateColumns: `repeat(${gridSize}, 1fr)`,
        }}
      >
        {gridItems}
      </div>
    </div>
  );

",,77743222_17u0s,"I'm currently facing issues while trying to create a grid based on a dynamically generated grid size variable in Tailwind CSS. When I use the variable to set grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns, the class names don't get compiled as expected. Instead, I'm getting class names with the generated values enclosed in square brackets.
Here's a snippet of the code:
const App = () => {
  const gridSize = getGridSize();
  const players = getPlayers();
  // const numberOfPlayers = players.length;
  const activePlayer = getActivePlayer();

  const gridItems = Array(gridSize * gridSize)
    .fill(null)
    .map((_, index) => (
      <div
        key={index}
        className=""bg-orange-300 rounded-lg w-16 h-16 cursor-pointer""
      ></div>
    ));

  return (
    <div
      className={`bg-[${players[activePlayer]}] w-[60vw] h-[100vh] mx-[20vw] flex justify-center items-center`}
    >
      <div className={`grid grid-rows-${gridSize} grid-cols-${gridSize} gap-2`}>
        {gridItems}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;


The problem is visible in the resulting class names with square brackets, as shown in this screenshot:

In contrast, when static values are used, the class names are applied correctly, as seen in this screenshot:

Please help me understand why these dynamic class values with Tailwind CSS variables aren't getting compiled as expected.

Cart is not an object but is the whole class. In Python, when you define a method of a class as
class Example:
    def foo(self, a):

you are saying that in order to call foo you will require an object of class Foo, which is self and an attribute a. Python automatically detects as self the object on which you call the method, for example:
instanceOfExample = Example()
a = 5
instanceOfExample.foo(a)

would be the same as doing:
instanceOfExample = Example()
a = 5
Example.foo(instanceOfExample, a)

Back to your code, by calling

Cart.add(food1)

you are giving a value for the first parameter of the function add defined by the class Cart, which is self and not food!

food1 = food(""Apples"", 8)

find the control you want to test
if there's an open button or icon (usually on the right) click it
if there's no button, click the control itself
wait for the listbox to be visible with .should('be.visible')
select the items in the list, filter the list to the one you want
scroll it into view
click it

While debugging in Chrome DevTools, I encountered an issue. Initially, I attempted to directly access a variable named emmei for debugging purposes (as we usually do in the console for normal JS files without type=""module""), but encountered an error message. Realizing that ES6 modules have their own scope and do not add their variables to the global scope, I explored alternative approaches.
My next attempt was to import the variable first in the Developer console and then access it. So, I executed:
import emmei from './app.js';

in the DevTools console window but encountered another error.
My notion is that if I could somehow find the correct path to where the app.js has been loaded in the Chrome browser, then we can import our variables from this file.

Encapsulation, plus automated testing, gives us programmers the confidence that we can rebuild parts of our app without the whole thing collapsing like a house of cards.

Board class in my GameLogic package which contains a 2D array with Piece objects

Imagine that you do pass your Board class or its array of pieces to the user-interface. Then, later, you decide to replace that 2D array with a different data structure. BAM! Now your app crashes, or fails to compile, because the UI code is trying to access an array that no longer exists.
To avoid that brittleness, your Board logic portion of your app can devise a data-structure describing the board’s state to communicate externally to the UI the current conditions in a way that does not unnecessarily disclose internal details.
Of course the Board must necessarily disclose that it tracks chess pieces, and that it knows the placement of those pieces. But the Board does not need to disclose the use of a 2D array, or a List of Lists, or a Map, or a bit-array, or any other data structure. And certainly the Board does not want give any external agent the power to directly manipulate that internal data structure.
The solution to the question of how to disclose the chess pieces and their placement information without disclosing internal implementation details is to create an intermediate communication layer.
For example, you could use Unicode’s chess characters to define a simple COMMA-delimited text-based description of the board in standard chess notation:
♖a1,♔a5,…

Now you are free to rewrite your Board class in any fashion you desire, even replace that 2D array, as long as the class continues to emit this same textual description.

Actually, you need not bother to devise your own chess engine to UI text description, as one has already been invented! The Universal Chess Interface (UCI) is an open communication protocol that enables chess engines to communicate with user interfaces.
",,77784241_wymD1,"I am building a CLI chess project (my first non-school project). I have a Board class in my GameLogic package which contains a 2D array with Piece objects to represent the board. I also have a ConsoleVisual class which renders the board to the console using StringBuilder. I wanted to structure my game logic in a single package so that everything is properly encapsulated, with as little public access to the inner workings of the game as possible.
My issue is that sending a board object outside the package to aide the ConsoleVisual class is the route of least resistance. Of course, I could just pass a string representation, but I eventually want a GUI, and a string will no longer cut it. It's hard to avoid passing that data outside of the package.
I am having trouble determining if sending this object outside the package would be bad convention. What should my decision making process look like when deciding to send objects outside of a package that you want to be encapsulated?

77239056_ZRqx3.png,77239056,ZRqx3,77239513,"I highly recommend using an NPM package like csv-parser which should handle all edge cases of your CSV file. However, if this is not an option, you can use this regular expression which can parse your example input but does not handle all use cases, such as escaped quotes:
(?<=^|,)(""([^""]*)""|[^,]*)(?=,|$)

Explanation:

(?<=^|,): Previous character should be a comma or the beginning of the line
(""([^""]*)""|[^,]*): Capturing group 1 should either be:

""([^""]*)"": Surrounded by double quotes and no "" within the string

([^""]*): Capture group 2 only captures the string within """"


[^,]*: Not surrounded by double quotes and no , within the string


(?=,|$): The next character should be a comma or the end of the line

Example implementation:
function simpleCSVParser(csv) {
    const re = /(?<=^|,)(""([^""]*)""|[^,]*)(?=,|$)/g,
        matches = csv.split('\n').map(csvLine => csvLine.matchAll(re)),
        csvData = [];
    for (let matchLine of matches) {
        csvData.push([]);
        for (let match of matchLine) {
            // Push match group 2 (double quoted string with quotes removed) to
            // the last line of the CSV if it exists, otherwise push match group 1
            csvData[csvData.length - 1].push(match[2] ?? match[1]);
        }
    }
    return csvData;
}

With your input of:
text,text,text,text
text,""text,text"",text,text

I've manually checked the database and ran the join query between 2 tables Website_order and social_media_adset, the data was present.
The Dashboard was working for every other brand_id and data ranges.
Tried to plot the table of website_orders without creating any blend/join in looker studio, The data plotted out as it should be i.e brand_id 26 had data for date range 1 aug - 20 aug.

",,78432698_pzH8uePf,"I am working on a API project which uses Laravel 11.  As mentioned when I send a PUT request on a certain endpoints I am getting the error:

""No query results for model""

Below you can find routes in the api.php code:
Route::prefix('area')->middleware('client')->group(function () {

        Route::delete('country', [CountryController::class, 'destroyMultiple']);
        Route::delete('city', [CityController::class, 'destroyMultiple']);
        Route::delete('district', [DistrictController::class, 'destroyMultiple']);
        Route::delete('neighborhood', [NeighborhoodController::class, 'destroyMultiple']);

        Route::apiResource('city', CityController::class);
        Route::apiResource('district', DistrictController::class);
        Route::apiResource('neighborhood', NeighborhoodController::class);
    });

I get this error for every PUT route except CountryController PUT route. Firstly this is a working endpoint in CountryController:
public function update(UpdateCountryRequest $request, Country $country)
    {
        DB::transaction(function () use ($request, $country) {
            $country->update($request->only(['country_abbreviation', 'country_code', 'logo', 'status']));

            $delete = [];

            foreach ($request->languages as $language) {
                $countryName = $country->CountryNames()->updateOrCreate([
                    'lang_id' => $language['lang_id'],
                    'country_id' => $country->id,
                ], $language);

                $delete[] = $countryName->id;
            }

            CountryLanguage::where('country_id', $country->id)->whereNotIn('id', $delete)->delete();
        });

        return response()->json([
            'message' => 'Country updated successfully',
            'status' => 'success',
        ]);
    }

And also the UpdateCountryRequest file as below:
public function authorize(): bool
{
    if ($this->user()->isAdmin) {
        return true;
    }

    return false;
}


public function rules(): array
{
    $country = $this->route('country');

    return [
        'country_abbreviation' => ['required', 'string', Rule::unique('countries')->ignore($country->id)], // keeping the same country_abbreviation seperately
        'country_code' => ['required', 'string', 'max:5', Rule::unique('countries')->ignore($country->id)],
        'logo' => ['required', 'string', 'max:255'],
        'status' => ['required', 'boolean'],
        'languages' => ['required', 'array'],
        'languages.*.lang_id' => ['required', 'integer', 'exists:languages,id'],
        'languages.*.country_name' => ['required', 'string'],
    ];
}

And Postman PUT Request:

But for other controllers when I send PUT request I get the mentioned error:

""No query results for model""

For example let me give you the same codes for DistrictController:
Update metot inside controller file:
 public function update(UpdateDistrictRequest $request, District $district)
    {
        DB::transaction(function () use ($request, $district) {
            $district->update($request->validated());
        });

        return response()->json(['message' => 'District updated successfully'], 200);
    }

UpdateDistrictRequest code:
public function authorize(): bool
{
    if ($this->user()->isAdmin) {
        return true;
    }

    return false;
}


public function rules(): array
{
    return [
        'service_id' => 'required|integer',
        'city_id' => 'required|integer|exists:cities,id',
        'name' => 'required|string|max:255',
        'status' => 'required|boolean',
    ];
}

And also the Postman PUT request:

I have checked if district exist with given id and it exist on database.

Below you can find migrations:
Country:
Schema::create('countries', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->id();
            $table->string('country_abbreviation');
            $table->string('country_code');
            $table->string('logo');
            $table->tinyInteger('status');
            $table->timestamps();
        });

District:
Schema::create('districts', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->id();
            $table->unsignedBigInteger('service_id')->nullable();
            $table->unsignedBigInteger('city_id');
            $table->foreign('city_id')->on('cities')->references('id')->onDelete('cascade');
            $table->string('name');
            $table->boolean('status')->default(1);
            $table->timestamps();
        });

And also models:
Country:
use HasFactory;

    protected $guarded = [];

    protected $fillable = [
        'country_abbreviation',
        'country_code',
        'logo',
        'status'
    ];

// ... Relationship methods

District:
protected $guarded = [];

    protected $fillable = [
        'service_id',
        'city_id',
        'name',
        'status'
    ];

// ... Relationship methods

When I run ""route:list"" method with artisan I can see the all put endpoints listed properly.
I have tried changing route definitions inside api.php. For example moving DistrictCotroller line to the top of it but it stills gives same error at the same time when I do that CountryController request still works properly.
The exception is throwned by this method inside src > Illuminate > Routing > ImlicitRouteBinding.php
public static function resolveForRoute($container, $route)
{
    $parameters = $route->parameters();

    $route = static::resolveBackedEnumsForRoute($route, $parameters);

    foreach ($route->signatureParameters(['subClass' => UrlRoutable::class]) as $parameter) {


        if (!$parameterName = static::getParameterName($parameter->getName(), $parameters)) {
            continue;
        }

        $parameterValue = $parameters[$parameterName];

        if ($parameterValue instanceof UrlRoutable) {
            continue;
        }

        $instance = $container->make(Reflector::getParameterClassName($parameter));

        $parent = $route->parentOfParameter($parameterName);

        $routeBindingMethod = $route->allowsTrashedBindings() && in_array(SoftDeletes::class, class_uses_recursive($instance))
            ? 'resolveSoftDeletableRouteBinding'
            : 'resolveRouteBinding';

        if (
            $parent instanceof UrlRoutable &&
            !$route->preventsScopedBindings() &&
            ($route->enforcesScopedBindings() || array_key_exists($parameterName, $route->bindingFields()))
        ) {
            $childRouteBindingMethod = $route->allowsTrashedBindings() && in_array(SoftDeletes::class, class_uses_recursive($instance))
                ? 'resolveSoftDeletableChildRouteBinding'
                : 'resolveChildRouteBinding';

            if (
                !$model = $parent->{$childRouteBindingMethod}(
                    $parameterName,
                    $parameterValue,
                    $route->bindingFieldFor($parameterName)
                )
            ) {
                throw (new ModelNotFoundException)->setModel(get_class($instance), [$parameterValue]);
            }
        } elseif (!$model = $instance->{$routeBindingMethod}($parameterValue, $route->bindingFieldFor($parameterName))) {
            // EXCEPTION
            throw (new ModelNotFoundException)->setModel(get_class($instance), [$parameterValue]);
        }

        $route->setParameter($parameterName, $model);
    }
}

I changed update methods in both CountryController and DistrictController as below and noticed that on DistrictController, querying database is just not working.
// CountryController update
public function update(UpdateCountryRequest $request, int $id)
    {
        dd($id, District::find($id)); // 1, District {#1444 ...}

// DistrictController update
public function update(UpdateDistrictRequest $request, int $id)
    {
        dd($id, District::find($id)); // 1, null

I double checked the namespaces in both controllers and they are identical.

It seems problem caused by Global Scopes which I've overlooked. On our models we have boot functions as below for registering Global Scopes to service container I believe :
// District Model
protected static function boot()
{
    parent::boot();

    static::addGlobalScope(new FilterBy('App\Services\V1\Area\DistrictFilters', request()->all()));
}

Also below you can find FilterBy scope file codes :
class FilterBy implements Scope
{
    protected $namespace;
    protected $filters;

    public function __construct($namespace, $filters)
    {
        $this->namespace = $namespace;
        $this->filters = $filters;
    }
    /**
     * Apply the scope to a given Eloquent query builder.
     */
    public function apply(Builder $builder, Model $model): void
    {
        $filter = new FilterBuilder($builder, $this->filters, $this->namespace);
        $builder = $filter->apply();
    }
}

And also in FilterBuilder class we are applying filters as below :
public function apply()
    {
        foreach ($this->filters as $name => $value) {
            $normailizedName = ucfirst($name);
            $class = $this->namespace . ""\\{$normailizedName}"";

            if (! class_exists($class)) {
                continue;
            }

            if (strlen($value)) {
                (new $class($this->query))->handle($value);
            } else {
                (new $class($this->query))->handle();
            }
        }

        return $this->query;
    }

And finally we have Name.php and CityId.php files inside the given App\Services\V1\Area\DistrictFilters namespace. They have handle methods inside them like below :
public function handle($value = """"): void
    {
        // Name.php
        $this->query->where('name', 'ilike','%'. $value .'%');
    }

So If I understand it correctly, when I send PUT request to let's say DistrictController for example, because of these QueryFilters unless I send the 'Name' field as it's saved in database, it just can't find the model.
For example I created a Distrcit record which has an Id with 974 as  below :

If I send a PUT request as below with same 'Name', it manages to find the Model and updates it :
{
    ""service_id"" : 1,
    ""city_id"" : 1,
    ""name"" : ""District"",
    ""status"" : 1
}

But If i send the same request with updated name something like 'District 123' it can't find Model.
So I updated the apply function inside FilterBy as below to prevent adding QueryFilters and this seems solved the problem :
public function apply(Builder $builder, Model $model): void
    {
        if (collect(['PUT', 'PATCH'])->contains(request()->method())) {
            return;
        }
        
        $filter = new FilterBuilder($builder, $this->filters, $this->namespace);
        $builder = $filter->apply();
    }

It would be faster to find the problem if I have shared the whole District Model code. It's my bad. Thank you everyone for trying to help.

My project structure:

"
78078192_sq7Kq.png,78078192,sq7Kq,78078274,"It looks like the 404 error you're encountering is because your intro-pages are located in the _components folder, not directly inside the app folder. To fix this, you'll need to create a new folder named about and within it, a page.tsx file.
I suggest checking the official Next.js website for guidance on structuring your project: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#pages
According to the documentation:

To create additional pages, you should create a new folder and add a
page.js file inside it (app/pagesYouCreated). For instance, to create
a page for the /dashboard route, you should create a folder called
dashboard and add the page.js file inside it.

Therefore, your folder structure should resemble the following:
./src
├── app
│   ├── _components // I recommend placing this folder outside the app folder, but within src as components and pages are treated differently in Next.js
│   ├── intro-pages
│   │   └── about
│   │       └── page.tsx

This setup ensures that your pages are correctly located for Next.js to route them properly. Moving the _components folder outside of the app but still within src will also help keep your project organized and maintain a clear separation between your components and pages.
To wrap up, make sure your pages are located in the correct directories as per Next.js conventions to avoid routing issues. Adjusting your project structure as recommended should resolve the 404 error. Happy coding!

77457552_HL6dX.png,77457552,HL6dX,77457567,"This is because, when using docker-compose, DNS resolves the name of your services (your services are main and redis as declared in your docker-compose file). When you enter redis:6379, it will automatically resolve to redis_container_ip_inside_network:6379.
Notice how you are declaring the service name in the compose file. Where are you declaring it when you're not using compose? Hint: you aren't, and this is why, when you use docker run, the container just doesn't know what redis:6379 means.
Instead of using redis:6379 as the redis endpoint, you will need to use redis_container_ip_inside_network:6379. You can assign the IP yourself so that it is always predictable by using the --ip parameter. Make sure the IP can be assigned to your docker network subnet (which you can also specify when creating the network with the --subnet parameter).
You can find your container IP addresses inside the network with the docker network inspect backend command when your containers are running.

77695363_4YQ66.png,77695363,4YQ66,77695434,"Your code exhibits undefined behavior, in two different ways.

GetSoundCategory() is returning a pointer to a local variable that gets freed when GetSoundCategory() exits, thus the returned pointer is left dangling, pointing at invalid memory before the caller ever has a chance to use it.
Since your arrays do not change, you can move them into global memory or static memory so that they stay alive after GetSoundCategory() exits, eg:
static const char* FILES1[3] = {
    ""/myfile1.mp3"",
    ""/this_is_my_file.mp3"",
    ""/myfile9.mp3""
};

static const char* FILES2[2] = {
    ""/I love S.E.mp3"",
    ""/please_help_me.mp3""
};   

const char** GetSoundCategory(int category)
{
    ...
}

Or:
const char** GetSoundCategory(int category)
{
    static const char* FILES1[3] = {
        ""/myfile1.mp3"",
        ""/this_is_my_file.mp3"",
        ""/myfile9.mp3""
    };

    static const char* FILES2[2] = {
        ""/I love S.E.mp3"",
         ""/please_help_me.mp3""
    };   

    ...
}


The way you have GetSoundCategory() coded, main() has no way of knowing how many strings are actually in the returned array.  So, when category == 2, it's loop ends up going out of bounds since there are only 2 strings in the array but the loop iterates 3 times.
To solve this, you have a few options.  You can either:

null-terminate the arrays, eg:
const char** GetSoundCategory(int category)
{
    static const char* FILES1[4] = {
        ""/myfile1.mp3"",
        ""/this_is_my_file.mp3"",
        ""/myfile9.mp3"",
        nullptr
    };

    static const char* FILES2[3] = {
        ""/I love S.E.mp3"",
        ""/please_help_me.mp3"",
        nullptr
    };   

    ...
}

...

const char** files = GetSoundCategory(2);

for (int i = 0; files[i] != nullptr; i++)
{
    printf(""%s\n"", files[i]);
}


return the array length as well as the array pointer.  You can do that with an output parameter, eg:
const char** GetSoundCategory(int category, int *length)
{
    ...

    *length = ...;
    return ...;
}

...

int number_of_files;
const char** files = GetSoundCategory(2, &number_of_files);

Or, return a simple struct that holds both the array pointer and the array length, eg:
struct filesArray {
    const char** files;
    int number_of_files;
};

filesArray GetSoundCategory(int category)
{
    ...

    filesArray fa;
    fa.files = ...;
    fa.number_of_files = ...;

    return fa;
}

...

filesArray fa = GetSoundCategory(2);

for (int i = 0; i < fa.number_of_files; i++)
{
    printf(""%s\n"", fa.files[i]);
}






That being said, you really should ditch the old C-based idioms in your code and embrace more modern C++ idioms, like std::vector, std::array, std::string(_view), etc, eg:
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <array>
#include <string_view>

std::vector<std::string_view> GetSoundCategory(int category)
{
    static std::array<const char*, 3> FILES1 = {
        ""/myfile1.mp3"",
        ""/this_is_my_file.mp3"",
        ""/myfile9.mp3""
    };

    static std::array<const char*, 2> FILES2 = {
        ""/I love S.E.mp3"",
        ""/please_help_me.mp3""
    };   

    switch (category)
    {
        case 1:
            return {FILES1.begin(), FILES1.end()};
        case 2:
            return {FILES2.begin(), FILES2.end()};
    }

    return {};
}

int main()
{
    auto files = GetSoundCategory(2);

    for (auto file : files)
    {
        std::cout << file << std::endl;
    }
}

",,77695363_4YQ66,"I'm a .NET guy, diving into the realm of C++/micro-controller stuff.
The following is a mockup of what I'm trying to do. I have a method which a value is passed in, and based on that value I want to return a different hard-coded array of strings.
When I step through this, my function in main() seems to work, and it looks like I'm returning the proper type in the function. I can set a breakpoint and see files[0] is the expected string, files[1] is the expected string, etc. I can step through the loop and set a watch for files[i] and I see the appropriate string. All is good there.
So two questions: How do I get how many elements are in the array? From reading a million posts, it seems like I'm not able to do this, right? Do I just need some end string (empty string, for example) that I need to check through as I loop through?
Second, you'll notice I have the printf() commented out. When I had that enabled, after stepping through the printf(), it would change the contents of the string, and I don't understand why it's doing that. See images for the before/after of the step-through and the result of the watches. I thought it might be because the strings aren't implicitly terminated with a \0, but that had no effect.

            }

            CountryLanguage::where('country_id', $country->id)->whereNotIn('id', $delete)->delete();
        });

        return response()->json([
            'message' => 'Country updated successfully',
            'status' => 'success',
        ]);
    }

And also the UpdateCountryRequest file as below:
public function authorize(): bool
{
    if ($this->user()->isAdmin) {
        return true;
    }

    return false;
}


public function rules(): array
{
    $country = $this->route('country');

    return [
        'country_abbreviation' => ['required', 'string', Rule::unique('countries')->ignore($country->id)], // keeping the same country_abbreviation seperately
        'country_code' => ['required', 'string', 'max:5', Rule::unique('countries')->ignore($country->id)],
        'logo' => ['required', 'string', 'max:255'],

        'languages.*.lang_id' => ['required', 'integer', 'exists:languages,id'],
        'languages.*.country_name' => ['required', 'string'],
    ];
}

And Postman PUT Request:

But for other controllers when I send PUT request I get the mentioned error:

""No query results for model""

For example let me give you the same codes for DistrictController:
Update metot inside controller file:
 public function update(UpdateDistrictRequest $request, District $district)
    {
        DB::transaction(function () use ($request, $district) {
            $district->update($request->validated());
        });

        return response()->json(['message' => 'District updated successfully'], 200);
    }

UpdateDistrictRequest code:
public function authorize(): bool
{
    if ($this->user()->isAdmin) {
        return true;
    }

    return false;
}


public function rules(): array
{
    return [
        'service_id' => 'required|integer',
        'city_id' => 'required|integer|exists:cities,id',
        'name' => 'required|string|max:255',
        'status' => 'required|boolean',
    ];
}

And also the Postman PUT request:

I have checked if district exist with given id and it exist on database.

Below you can find migrations:
Country:
Schema::create('countries', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->id();
            $table->string('country_abbreviation');
            $table->string('country_code');
            $table->string('logo');
            $table->tinyInteger('status');
            $table->timestamps();
        });

District:
Schema::create('districts', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->id();
            $table->unsignedBigInteger('service_id')->nullable();
            $table->unsignedBigInteger('city_id');
            $table->foreign('city_id')->on('cities')->references('id')->onDelete('cascade');
            $table->string('name');
            $table->boolean('status')->default(1);
            $table->timestamps();
        });

And also models:
Country:
use HasFactory;

    protected $guarded = [];

    protected $fillable = [
        'country_abbreviation',
        'country_code',
        'logo',
        'status'
    ];

// ... Relationship methods

District:
protected $guarded = [];

    protected $fillable = [
        'service_id',
        'city_id',
        'name',
        'status'
    ];

// ... Relationship methods

When I run ""route:list"" method with artisan I can see the all put endpoints listed properly.
I have tried changing route definitions inside api.php. For example moving DistrictCotroller line to the top of it but it stills gives same error at the same time when I do that CountryController request still works properly.
The exception is throwned by this method inside src > Illuminate > Routing > ImlicitRouteBinding.php
public static function resolveForRoute($container, $route)
{
    $parameters = $route->parameters();

    $route = static::resolveBackedEnumsForRoute($route, $parameters);

    foreach ($route->signatureParameters(['subClass' => UrlRoutable::class]) as $parameter) {


        if (!$parameterName = static::getParameterName($parameter->getName(), $parameters)) {
            continue;
        }

        $parameterValue = $parameters[$parameterName];

        if ($parameterValue instanceof UrlRoutable) {
            continue;
        }

        $instance = $container->make(Reflector::getParameterClassName($parameter));

        $parent = $route->parentOfParameter($parameterName);

        $routeBindingMethod = $route->allowsTrashedBindings() && in_array(SoftDeletes::class, class_uses_recursive($instance))
            ? 'resolveSoftDeletableRouteBinding'
            : 'resolveRouteBinding';

        if (
            $parent instanceof UrlRoutable &&
            !$route->preventsScopedBindings() &&
            ($route->enforcesScopedBindings() || array_key_exists($parameterName, $route->bindingFields()))
        ) {
            $childRouteBindingMethod = $route->allowsTrashedBindings() && in_array(SoftDeletes::class, class_uses_recursive($instance))
                ? 'resolveSoftDeletableChildRouteBinding'
                : 'resolveChildRouteBinding';

            if (
                !$model = $parent->{$childRouteBindingMethod}(
                    $parameterName,
                    $parameterValue,
                    $route->bindingFieldFor($parameterName)
                )
            ) {
                throw (new ModelNotFoundException)->setModel(get_class($instance), [$parameterValue]);
            }
        } elseif (!$model = $instance->{$routeBindingMethod}($parameterValue, $route->bindingFieldFor($parameterName))) {
            // EXCEPTION
            throw (new ModelNotFoundException)->setModel(get_class($instance), [$parameterValue]);
        }

        $route->setParameter($parameterName, $model);
    }
}

I changed update methods in both CountryController and DistrictController as below and noticed that on DistrictController, querying database is just not working.
// CountryController update
public function update(UpdateCountryRequest $request, int $id)
    {
        dd($id, District::find($id)); // 1, District {#1444 ...}

// DistrictController update
public function update(UpdateDistrictRequest $request, int $id)
    {
        dd($id, District::find($id)); // 1, null

I double checked the namespaces in both controllers and they are identical.

It seems problem caused by Global Scopes which I've overlooked. On our models we have boot functions as below for registering Global Scopes to service container I believe :
// District Model
protected static function boot()
{
    parent::boot();

    static::addGlobalScope(new FilterBy('App\Services\V1\Area\DistrictFilters', request()->all()));
}

Also below you can find FilterBy scope file codes :
class FilterBy implements Scope
{
    protected $namespace;
    protected $filters;

    public function __construct($namespace, $filters)
    {
        $this->namespace = $namespace;
        $this->filters = $filters;
    }
    /**
     * Apply the scope to a given Eloquent query builder.
     */
    public function apply(Builder $builder, Model $model): void
    {
        $filter = new FilterBuilder($builder, $this->filters, $this->namespace);
        $builder = $filter->apply();
    }
}

And also in FilterBuilder class we are applying filters as below :
public function apply()
    {
        foreach ($this->filters as $name => $value) {
            $normailizedName = ucfirst($name);
            $class = $this->namespace . ""\\{$normailizedName}"";

            if (! class_exists($class)) {
                continue;
            }

            if (strlen($value)) {
                (new $class($this->query))->handle($value);
            } else {
                (new $class($this->query))->handle();
            }
        }

        return $this->query;
    }

And finally we have Name.php and CityId.php files inside the given App\Services\V1\Area\DistrictFilters namespace. They have handle methods inside them like below :
public function handle($value = """"): void
    {
        // Name.php
        $this->query->where('name', 'ilike','%'. $value .'%');
    }

So If I understand it correctly, when I send PUT request to let's say DistrictController for example, because of these QueryFilters unless I send the 'Name' field as it's saved in database, it just can't find the model.
For example I created a Distrcit record which has an Id with 974 as  below :

If I send a PUT request as below with same 'Name', it manages to find the Model and updates it :
{
    ""service_id"" : 1,
    ""city_id"" : 1,
    ""name"" : ""District"",
    ""status"" : 1
}

But If i send the same request with updated name something like 'District 123' it can't find Model.
So I updated the apply function inside FilterBy as below to prevent adding QueryFilters and this seems solved the problem :
public function apply(Builder $builder, Model $model): void
    {
        if (collect(['PUT', 'PATCH'])->contains(request()->method())) {
            return;
        }
        
        $filter = new FilterBuilder($builder, $this->filters, $this->namespace);
        $builder = $filter->apply();
    }

It would be faster to find the problem if I have shared the whole District Model code. It's my bad. Thank you everyone for trying to help.

But that is just in terms of XPath (1) syntax and semantics, I have no idea whether it will work in the particular, somehow restricted environment you use.
",,77161253_88JqU,"Windows Event Viewer (WEV) allows custom queries using ""a subset of XPath 1.0.""1  I've been unsuccessfully struggling for a couple hours to craft a query that works. I'm hoping someone on the stack knows XPath 1.0 better than I...  At this point I'm not sure if the XPath ""subset"" WEV accepts doesn't accept contains(), or if I'm just not crafting a valid query.  (I am very n00b at XPath.)
What I think should work is *[EventData[Data[contains(text(),""foo""]]] or *[Event[contains(Data, ""foo"")]].  The intent is to select every node that has an EventData element that has a Data element that contains the substring ""foo"" in its text content.
FWIW, the query *[EventData[Data]] does select every node that has an EventData element that has a Data element.  I just need to narrow the 30,622 results down to the 7 that I know contain ""foo"".
Edit
@gilles-quénot was unclear on what I'm asking, so here are step by step how to reproduce and expected output:

Open Windows Event Viewer (%windir%\system32\eventvwr.msc /s)

Open the System logs




Click on Create Custom View... (on right side of window), select the XML tab, and enable Edit query manually.



Change the query to:

<QueryList>
  <Query Id=""0"" Path=""System"">
    <Select Path=""System"">*[EventData[Data[@Name=""updateTitle""]]]</Select>
  </Query>
</QueryList>


Click the OK button twice, and you should have selected a couple hundred to a couple thousand events depending on how many updates your system has had.  Here is an example event:



Edit the filter to change the Select element to <Select Path=""System"">*[EventData[contains(Data, ""Intelligence Update"")]]</Select>, click OK twice and you should get this error message:


No messages are selected.
Edit 2
I found a link that documents WEV's XPath 1.0 limitations.  Unfortunately, I find the documentation a little ambiguous.  On the one hand it says ""Any valid XPath expression is acceptable if the location paths conform to the following restrictions.""  In those restrictions it does not say the XPath 1.0 functions are not supported, and it explicitly says the position function, band function, and timediff functions are supported.
On the other hand, it definitely seems WEV does not accept a valid XPath 1.0 query (e.g. ""*[EventData[Data[contains(., ""Intelligence Update"")]]]), so the implications is that WEV does not support any of the XPath 1.0 functions except the three mentioned in the restrictions.
Comment on possible duplicates
This question was marked as a duplicate, but it doesn't overlap with any of the questions that were proposed as duplicates. My query is specifically for Windows Event Viewer which uses XPath 1.0 syntax as part of its filter implementation.
It is probable that future users of Windows Event Viewer will have this question and might not find it if this question is closed, because the others do not reference WEV.

Surprisingly, I'm not getting any OpenGL errors either from my load_texture_from_file function. In my code, load_texture_from_file is called within display_ui which does the following:

78366032_5BKgc.png,78366032,5BKgc,78366751,"Answer:.Decode(&doc)→ Decoding Makes Body Empty
This issue arises because when you read from http.Request.Body, which is an io.ReadCloser, the data is consumed and is not available for subsequent reads. Apparently, this is a common mistake, especially when multiple handlers or middleware need to access the request body.
To fix this, you need to read the entire body first, and then restore it so that it can be re-read by subsequent handlers or middleware. Here’s the essential piece of code that accomplishes this:
// Read the entire body
bodyBytes, err := io.ReadAll(r.Body)
if err != nil {
    http.Error(w, ""Error reading request body"", http.StatusInternalServerError)
    return
}
// Restore the io.ReadCloser to its original state
r.Body = io.NopCloser(bytes.NewBuffer(bodyBytes))

//code continues...
// Read and decode the request body into a generic map to determine the type of document
var doc map[string]interface{} //...


Explanation:

Consuming the Body: The json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&doc) operation reads the entire contents of the io.ReadCloser stream. Once read, the stream is empty because io.ReadCloser does not support rewinding. This effectively ""consumes"" the body, making it empty for any subsequent attempts to read it.

Restoring the Body: After reading, r.Body is re-assigned using io.NopCloser(bytes.NewBuffer(bodyBytes)). This line creates a new io.ReadCloser from the bodyBytes we read earlier, effectively duplicating the original content. io.NopCloser is used to convert an io.Reader (returned by bytes.NewBuffer) into an io.ReadCloser without adding any functionality to close, as the buffer does not need to be closed.


This approach ensures that any middleware or handler that runs after this code will still have access to the full request body as if it were untouched.
Why This Is Important:
Not handling the request body correctly can lead to subtle bugs, especially in larger applications where multiple parts of the middleware chain may need to inspect or modify the request. This technique ensures that all parts of your HTTP server can operate correctly without interfering with each other.
",,78366032_5BKgc,"I'm developing a middleware in Go that intercepts HTTP requests, reads JSON data from the request body, and indexes it as a document in Elasticsearch based on this documentation.
However, although the document appears to be indexed in Elasticsearch, the process returns an Invalid JSON format: EOF error. This error prevents the middleware from proceeding to the main handler that performs additional database operations.
Here is the relevant part of my middleware code:

Specific Questions:

What could be causing the ""Invalid JSON format: EOF"" error even though the document seems to be indexed successfully?
How can I ensure that the JSON data is properly handled and no errors are returned so that the middleware can proceed to the main handler?

Any insights or suggestions to address this issue would be greatly appreciated!

78363878_8CJ73.png,78363878,8CJ73,78363920,"Highly recommend reading the documentation about hooks.
The issue you are having is because you are firing state in the render path IE what is being returned in the UI. Never do this.
TLDR: Never fire state updates in the react render method.

confCon is the reason it is looping b/c it fires a sideEffect directly in the render.
It updates state, then state re-renders, but rendering method fires an update to state, which triggers another render ...until your app crashes.
confCon should only be responsible for rendering the UI data. Abstract any sideEffects with a useEffect (such as calling an API or updating state).

For state updating methods they need to be in be in an interactable element IE a button onClick, or a called within a useEffect that contains a dependency array that is not related to the dependency being updated (if it is it will loop).
Without these critical steps, your component will attempt to re-render until it hits callstack limits due to recursion.

Removing messagestring and calling Chat confirmation is: {confCon()} directly but triggers the same issue
Tried Chat confirmation is: {confCon} but then the code doesn't execute
Tried removing the state for the count which counts up to 25 but the timeout still happens I just lose the count.

I'm really confused because I've used code like this before where I define a function and call that function in return like <div>{someFunction}</div> so I'm not sure where I'm going wrong here.

The first step is to download the sample application to your own machine so you can look at Dockerfile or docker-compose and understand how to use Docker. If you do not have git installed on your machine you should do so, then use git clone command to clone the sample application repository to your machine. Check out git documentation if you are not familiar: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone

With the sample application installed, you should see Dockerfile and docker-compose inside the project directory.

Docker layers and images are stored at C:\ProgramData\docker. Check out this page for more detailed information: https://github.com/docker/getting-started-app

You can create docker projects everywhere, the commands connect to the Docker engine with api and create the images/containers in its own file system. See for more info: https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/#docker-architecture

Does Docker Desktop require that I install git separately, or is it included?

Secondly, it assumes I know where to find the Dockerfile.
I have no idea where it is - where is it?

Thirdly, if I pull an image down using Docker Desktop, where does it store the image/files locally? If I run this command in the CLI, do I need to be in a DOS/PS prompt, or do I need to run it from within the WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) shell? And what directory should I be in when I run it?

Fourthly, where is the compose.yaml file located?

Fifthly, do Docker project folders need to be located somewhere specifically relative to the Docker Desktop application itself for docker commands to work properly, or can I create Docker project folders anywhere that suits my folder management scheme?

77268448_2MeBK.png,77268448,2MeBK,77270850,"As Konrad mentioned, the issue on your side comes from the wrong usage of the  tag.
It should includes a src attribute, but the attribute is not properly set. Instead, the src attribute is surrounded by the opening and closing script tags, which is not a valid way to include an external JavaScript file.
In this incorrect code you showed, the entire <script> src=""script2.js""</script> will be treated as plain text content within the HTML document. It will not be recognized as an external JavaScript file reference, and the content inside script2.js will not be executed as JavaScript.
To properly include an external JavaScript file, you should use the correct syntax, as follows:
<script src=""script2.js""></script>

This way, the browser will recognize it as an external script and attempt to load and execute the JavaScript code from the script2.js file.

77924392_s7lg4.png,77924392,s7lg4,77924410,"The docs you linked to say:

CLASS column
Includes class selectors, such as .myClass, attribute
selectors like [type=""radio""] and [lang|=""fr""], and pseudo-classes,
such as :hover, :nth-of-type(3n), and :required.

Both .bg-neutral-50 and [type=button] fall into this category, so both of the selectors have specificity 0-1-0. This can be seen in Safari or Chrome dev tools by hovering on the selector:

styles.css has:
[type=button],
[type=reset],
[type=submit],
button {
  -webkit-appearance:button;
  background-color:transparent;
  background-image:none
}

The background-color is being set to transparent because of this.
But rfui-v0-1-11.css has:
.bg-neutral-50 {
  --tw-bg-opacity:1;
  background-color:rgb(var(--color-neutral-50)/var(--tw-bg-opacity))
}

I don't understand why that selector doesn't take precedence and why it's value of background-color doesn't get applied.

Here's how I'm thinking about it.

I refer to these docs for the cascading order.
For ""1. Relevance"", both selectors match the <button> and thus don't get filtered out.
For ""2. Origin and importance"", they're both the same. Both have an origin of ""author (developer)"" and an importance of ""normal"".
For ""3. Specificity"", .bg-neutral-50 has a higher specificity than [type=button]. 0-1-0 vs 0-0-1. So then, .bg-neutral-50 should take precedence and have it's value for background-color applied.

When the file is sent, I see two different numbers at the client, the first one is the total number of bytes received minus the size of the header of each packet - which is 8 bytes.
It says that I received 1,814,239 bytes ""the number written at the right terminal"". So, there are 8 bytes that are missing in the receive from function.

The bigger issue is when I try to inspect the file size in its directory, it gives me 1,810,500 bytes, which is far away from the real number.

The structs of packets, data packet and acknowledge packet:
struct ack_packet {

s is the variable that tells me in the client how many bytes are received.
I suspected the write function in the ofstream to be ignoring some of the write operations, maybe because it has some sort of internal buffer that was filled during some of the receives. However, I think that this is not right.

77743222_KBe7c.png,77743222,KBe7c,77743337,"As per the documentation:

The most important implication of how Tailwind extracts class names is that it will only find classes that exist as complete unbroken strings in your source files.
If you use string interpolation or concatenate partial class names together, Tailwind will not find them and therefore will not generate the corresponding CSS:
Don’t construct class names dynamically
<div class=""text-{{ error ? 'red' : 'green' }}-600""></div>

In the example above, the strings text-red-600 and text-green-600 do not exist, so Tailwind will not generate those classes.
Instead, make sure any class names you’re using exist in full:
Always use complete class names
<div class=""{{ error ? 'text-red-600' : 'text-green-600' }}""></div>


You could look at using the style attribute instead like:
const App = () => {
  // …

When I use the variable to set grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns, the class names don't get compiled as expected. Instead, I'm getting class names with the generated values enclosed in square brackets.
Here's a snippet of the code:
const App = () => {
  const gridSize = getGridSize();
  const players = getPlayers();
  // const numberOfPlayers = players.length;
  const activePlayer = getActivePlayer();

  const gridItems = Array(gridSize * gridSize)

def run(command_queue: queue.Queue[int], status: PlantStatus) -> None:
    ...

Since you are new to the language, keep in mind that typing is optional and only requested by the tooling that surrounds your development stage: if you ever get to a situation where proper typing would be too complicated, you can always just ignore it altogether.
(in time: this syntax is implemented for queue.Queue from Python 3.9 onwards)
This is documented here: https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/stdtypes.html#types-genericalias - although the documentation only uses examples of the built-in types, other collections defined in Python's stdlib also work that way. The full reasoning and implementation is described on PEP 585 - https://peps.python.org/pep-0585/ . Support for this even comes for free if one implements their collection classes inheriting from the appropriate abstract base classes in collections.abc .
Nonetheless, regardless of being able to find the proper documentation for typing something, keep in mind that Typing expressions following the : must be valid (""classic"") Python expressions themselves. So the < and > symbos are only used as operators in the language, and never as brackets - and since the language could actually make use of the [ and ] for classes even before any language changes were made to support it (as  operator overloading for classes would already work since Python 2.2, and it was just a matter of defining how [ ]  indexing would work for classes), those were adopted.

What I would like is to have a double row header such as :

My constraint is that it has to be done on specific objects : either directly on R dataframe or possibly on DT::datatable. But I am not sure this is possible, and if so, really don't know how.
I found solutions using flextable or raw html but it does not suit really well my goal. (EDIT : also tried the kableExtra::add_header_above which works but prevents me from keeping my DT::datatable object in my rmd)
EDIT : the folowing solutions almost do the job BUT it seems to me that I need to leave aside the DT::datatable represensation.

",,77755115_lit17,"SonarLint's rule java:S135 says:

Loops should not contain more than a single ""break"" or ""continue""
statement
The use of break and continue statements increases the complexity of
the control flow and makes it harder to understand the program logic.
In order to keep a good program structure, they should not be applied
more than once per loop. This rule reports an issue when there is more
than one break or continue statement in a loop. The code should be
refactored to increase readability if there is more than one.

And gives this example:
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {     // Noncompliant; two ""continue"" statements
  if (i % 2 == 0) {
    continue;
  }

  if (i % 3 == 0) {
    continue;
  }
  // ...
}

Should be refactored to:
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  if (i % 2 == 0 || i % 3 == 0) {
    continue;
  }
  // ...
}

But it looks weird. I have this test example:
@Slf4j
public class TestService {

    public int test(List<String> input) {
        int count = 0;
        for (String s : input) {

                log.info(""one was called"");
                processOne(s);
                continue;
            }

            String something = getSomethingBy(s);
            if (something == null) {
                log.info(""something is null"");
                sendEmail();
                continue;
            }

            if (""TWO"".equals(s) && ""hz"".equals(something)) {
                process(s);
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

and sonarLint claims:

If I change this code to:
public int testGoodForSonarLint(List<String> input) {
        int count = 0;
        for (String s : input) {
            if (""ONE"".equals(s)) {
                log.info(""one was called"");
                processOne(s);
            } else {
                String something = getSomethingBy(s);
                if (something == null) {
                    log.info(""something is null"");
                    sendEmail();
                } else if (""TWO"".equals(s) && ""hz"".equals(something)) {
                    process(s);
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

It looks so bad. I hate that if-else chin and hell of {}. The code looks like a Christmas tree.
And it is with 2 continue. In real code, I have 4. So, it is not always possible to refactor as SonarLint suggests:
if (i % 2 == 0 || i % 3 == 0) {
        continue;
      }

Because I need to do something in each condition, not just continue.
Maybe I don't understand something but interapting cycle by continue or break looks much better and readable than brackets hell. What do you think, is it possible to rewrite this code? if yes, how would you refactor my example?

type* p = new type();


p is a raw owning pointer. Raw owning pointers should be avoided all together. Raw owning pointers have no support for managing ownership, it is all up to you.
Next,

std::shared_ptr<type> ptr1(p);


you transfer ownership from p to ptr1. The shared pointer does support managing ownership. Internally it keeps a reference count when you share ownership via this instance.
Next,

std::shared_ptr<type> ptr2(p);


you transfer ownership from p to ptr2. However, you did already transfer ownership away from p. There is already  a second seperate shared pointer that does own the object. ptr2 cannot know about that already existing other shared pointer, because you transfer ownership from p. p is a raw pointer and has no support to manage ownership.
The reference count of both shared pointers is 1, because they both believe they would be the only owner of the object.

If you want to get a second shared pointer that shares ownership with an already existing shared pointer, you can make a copy:
type* p = new type();
std::shared_ptr<type> ptr1(p);
std::shared_ptr<type> ptr2(ptr1);
std::cout << ptr2.use_count();

In that code, ptr1 and ptr2 share the ownership of the object. Whichever pointer leaves the scope last will destroy the object. In your code both will attempt to destroy the object, because you made them both the sole owner of the object.
Smart pointers do not release you from having a clear concept of ownership, but rather they enable you to express it clearly in the code. You can still use them wrong, its just a little harder as compared to using raw pointers.

Two shared_ptrs are referencing the same raw pointer, so why is the ref count 1?

With the current Provider setup, Crossplane automatically upgrades Providers without ArgoCD knowing anything about it. And thus trying to reconcile the state to what's stated in Git. Thus both mechanisms will get into an ongoing 'fight'.
To get ArgoCD into the lead of Provider upgrades through Git commits, we should configure the packagePullPolicy to IfNotPresent instead of Always, which means ""Check for new packages every minute and download any matching package that isn’t in the cache"" as the docs state:
apiVersion: pkg.crossplane.io/v1
kind: Provider
metadata:
  name: provider-aws-s3
spec:
  package: xpkg.upbound.io/upbound/provider-aws-ec2:v1.1.1
  packagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  revisionActivationPolicy: Automatic
  revisionHistoryLimit: 1

BUT interestingly we need to leave the revisionActivationPolicy to Automatic! Since otherwise, the Provider will never get active and healty! I found the docs aren't that clear on this point here.
TLDR; with packagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent Crossplane will not automatically pull new Provider versions and only a git commit with a Provider version change will trigger the download - and also the upgrade through revisionActivationPolicy: Automatic`.
Remember to be a bit patient for the upgrade to run through - it will take up to a few minutes and depends on what the Provider to upgrade has to do right now (we waited to short and thus thought this configuration is wrong, but it is not).

This should grow the partition into all available space on the disk as indicated by lsblk, after which you need to run the following to also resize the filesystem:

Obviously you should snapshot the system first before making any type of changes to disks and partitions as it may break your root partition.
