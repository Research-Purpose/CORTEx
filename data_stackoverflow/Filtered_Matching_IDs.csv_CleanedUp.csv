Each of my axios requests also include this { withCredentials: true } config, so that shouldn't be the problem. THINGS I'VE TRIED: I've seen a lot of CORS related posts regarding this issue, and I think I have implemented the requirements as follows:  CORSMiddleware allowed origins on backend configured to receive requests from my frontend (127.0.0.1:3000) allow_credentials=True on backend Frontend and backend located at same domain: 127.0.0.1 requests from frontend configured with withCredentials: true  BROWSER TOOLS: I also checked the browser tools Network tab and saw that my session was being correctly recorded following my POST request to login/authenticate:  But any followup requests to my backend do not contain this session cookie, so they promptly fail my authentication check:  Shouldn't my session cookie show up in those request headers so that my backend can retrieve them?

It works in regexr (after removing beginning \. that is actually accounted for with ^ in the javascript code) (test cases reflect usage)  I also tested regexr with removing the ^ and results were the same.

I already removed a set of parantheses around the whole thing (which I was already iffy about, since that $ end character needs to apply to both sides of the ""or"" set) when the unmatched paranthesis error first came up.

78653532,Does Rust's move semantics involve copying data?,"I am curious about the ""move semantics"" in Rust and whether data is copied when ownership is transferred.

To investigate further, I used the debug functionality in VSCode with a plugin called ""Hex Editor"" and found that both foo and bar ( memory addresses 0x7fffffffd7d8 and 0x7fffffffd828), containing identical data (6F 00 00 00 01 00 00 00).  Does this indicate that Rust actually performs a copy operation even during a move, such as copying a struct in this case? Could this behavior vary depending on whether it's in release mode?

78639185,Accessing Vagrant-deployed OPNSense Firewall,"I've been playing with Vagrant to deploy some OPNSense firewalls. I'm currently using rudibroekhuizen/opnsense as I had some issue or other with the more recent ones. It deploys correctly. However, I've had some issues accessing the firewall from the other VM's that are part of the deployment. While a standard Ubuntu box has an IP assigned to it, the OPNsense boxes aren't. I'm very new to Vagrant (and firewalls more generally - trying to use this to learn), so I'm not sure if this is specific to the firewalls, although I'm thinking it is. I'm using the following Vagrantfile:     # -*- mode: ruby -*-     # vi: set ft=ruby :      # 192.168.56.0/21 range reserved     servers=[       { # root/opnsense         :hostname => ""web"",         :ip => ""192.168.57.10"",         :box => ""rudibroekhuizen/opnsense"",         :ram => 1024,         :cpu => 2       },       {         :hostname => ""db"",         :ip => ""192.168.57.11"",         :box => ""rudibroekhuizen/opnsense"",         :ram => 1024,         :cpu => 2       },       {# vagrant/vagrant         :hostname => ""control_node"",         :ip => ""192.168.57.12"",         :box => ""ubuntu/trusty64"",         :ram => 1024,         :cpu => 2           }     ]          Vagrant.configure(""2"") do |config|         config.vm.provider ""virtualbox"" do |v|           v.check_guest_additions = false         end         servers.each do |machine|             config.vm.define machine[:hostname] do |node|                 node.vm.box_check_update = false                 node.vm.box = machine[:box]                   node.vm.network :private_network, ip: machine[:ip]                   node.vm.synced_folder '.', '/vagrant', disabled: true               node.vm.provision ""file"", source: ""~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"", destination: ""~/.ssh/my_key.pub""               node.vm.provision ""shell"", inline: <<-SHELL                 if [ -e ~/my_key.pub ] ; then cat ~/my_key.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys ; fi;             SHELL             end         end     end  ip -a on the control_node shows the correct IP being assigned:  but the OPNSense machine seems to be doing it's own thing?  If I add another ubuntu/trusty64 box, the two ubuntu boxes can ping each other, so it's something to do with the OPNsense box. But, going by the OPNSense installation docs I think I should just be able to access the firewall? If it's relevant, I'm running Oracle VM Virtualbox Manager in Windows, and running the Vagrant script in a WSL installation. Thanks!

If I list the percentile functions explicitly, it seems they work all right. quantile_funcs = [lambda x : x.quantile(0.05), lambda x : x.quantile(0.85)]  data = {'group':['A', 'B', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'A', 'A'], 'col1':[1, 3, 3, 5, 4, 6, 7, 7, 8]} df = pd.DataFrame(data) df['col2']=df['col1']+1 df_sum = df.groupby(['group']).agg([*quantile_funcs, ""count"", 'mean']) df_sum.columns = ['c1_P5', 'c1_p85', 'c1_ct', 'c1_mean', 'c2_P5', 'c2_p85', 'c2_ct', 'c2_mean'] print(df_sum)  The results are right and the quantile_funcs point to two lambda functions under __main__. See screenshot below.  However, if I didn't list the percentile function explicitly but generate the list of functions through a loop. It gave me weird results. percentiles = [0.05, 0.85] quantile_funcs = [lambda x: x.quantile(p) for p in percentiles]  data = {'group':['A', 'B', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'A', 'A'], 'col1':[1, 3, 3, 5, 4, 6, 7, 7, 8]} df = pd.DataFrame(data) df['col2']=df['col1']+1 df_sum = df.groupby(['group']).agg([*quantile_funcs, ""count"", 'mean']) df_sum.columns = ['c1_P5', 'c1_p85', 'c1_ct', 'c1_mean', 'c2_P5', 'c2_p85', 'c2_ct', 'c2_mean'] print(df_sum)  The results are weird. it seems only the last quantile in the list is used.

78582453,"Is it possible to import variables from ES6 modules directly in Chrome DevTools console for Debugging purpose? (in pure HTML, JS project)","I'm working on a web application utilizing ES6 modules in Chrome by using type=""module"" in my HTML script tag. While debugging in Chrome DevTools, I encountered an issue. Initially, I attempted to directly access a variable named emmei for debugging purposes (as we usually do in the console for normal JS files without type=""module""), but encountered an error message. Realizing that ES6 modules have their own scope and do not add their variables to the global scope, I explored alternative approaches. My next attempt was to import the variable first in the Developer console and then access it. So, I executed: import emmei from './app.js';  in the DevTools console window but encountered another error. My notion is that if I could somehow find the correct path to where the app.js has been loaded in the Chrome browser, then we can import our variables from this file. Again I tried with import emmei from './Sources/app.js' but to no success. QUESTION: Given that ES6 modules have their own scope and don't add variables to the global scope, I'm now wondering if there's a way to find the correct path to import variables from ES6 modules in Chrome DevTools?    UPDATE With help from Mr. @Bergi in the comment, we are able to get access to the Module (I believe a constructor) using this syntax in the DevTools console. await import('./app.js')  We are very close now, Need to somehow be able to get our exported variables from the app.js now. I tried with .then() [since await (async function returns promise)], but not yet able to get the variable extracted. Any ideas to share here?    class Doctor {   constructor(name, age) {     this.name = name     this.age = age   }    getDetails() {     console.log(`My name is :${this.name} & I am ${this.age} years old`)   } }  // Surgeon is a Doctor --- is-a relationship (a good candidate for inheritance) class Surgeon extends Doctor {   constructor(name, age, profession) {     super(name, age)     this.profession = profession   }    specialization() {     console.log(`I am a ${this.profession}`)   } }  const emmei = new Surgeon('emmei', 32, 'heart specialist')  export default emmei   <body>     <div class=""block bcg-black""></div>     <div class=""block"">       <div class=""container"">         <img           src=""https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/men/75.jpg""           alt=""random user""           class=""user-img""         />          <p class=""user-title"">My name is</p>         <p class=""user-value"">Emmei White</p>          <div class=""values-list"">           <!-- icons goes here -->           <button             class=""icon active""             data-label=""name""           >             <span class=""far fa-user""></span>           </button>            <button             class=""icon""             data-label=""email""           >             <span class=""far fa-envelope-open""></span>           </button>         </div>          <button           class=""btn""           type=""button""         >           random user         </button>       </div>     </div>     <script       type=""module""       src=""./app.js""     ></script>   </body>    ","['https://i.sstatic.net/VCTExGat.png', 'https://i.sstatic.net/ocDGzFA4.png', 'https://i.sstatic.net/lR0i3W9F.png', 'https://i.sstatic.net/DdTRJoR4.png']"

NA's are even excluded via filter in the call_data_all dataframe definition. The aim of this R script is to perform data processing on our helpdesk call data to calculate business hour differences for response and resolution times, excluding weekends and specified holidays. The script includes several steps: it defines functions to count excluded days (holidays and weekends) and to calculate business hour differences between two timestamps. It then connects to a customer services database to retrieve raw helpdesk data. The script processes the data to create three subsets: calls that are still open, deferred calls that have a response but no closure date, and all other calls. It calculates the business response and resolution times in business hours, adjusts them to days, and adds additional date-related columns for further analysis.

78563781,How to create an OnDrop event with non-UI?,"I am making a 2D unity drag and drop quiz game. The first thing I tried to make the OnDrop event work was to use the IDropHandler interface and apply that script to my answer slot. The code is below: public void OnDrop(PointerEventData eventData)     {         Debug.Log(""Ondrop"");     }  However, in my console, I only received the OnEndDrag debug message but not the Ondrop. The solution I found was to togglecanvasGroup.blocksRaycasts to true after the EndDrag event so that the answer slot could detect the Ondrop event. However, this will not work in my situation because the draggable game object is not a UI element and does not have a canvasGroup associated with it. Is there a similar method to disable raycasts for my draggable game object, which is instantiated at runtime? The second method I explored was using colliders. I followed this link: https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/200538/how-to-use-ondrop-on-non-ui-elements and had attached a non-kinematic rigid body to my incorrect answer slot for testing purposes and a box collider to both the draggable prefab and the incorrect answer slot. The code and inspector for the answer slot is shown below:   private void OnCollisionEnter2D(Collision2D collision)     {         Debug.Log(""collision"");     }  However, I did not get any debug message despite dragging the draggable over the answer slot. The third method I tried was using triggers. For this, I had the same setup as the collider setup above, but checked the isTrigger boolean on the answer slot.   private void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D collision)     {         Debug.Log(""trigger"");     }  The debug message was not logged to my console too. What will be the best and easiest way for me to implement this OnDrop event for my quiz game, where the draggables are instantiated at runtime as non-UI elements? Thank you.

If I run button Go2 (with a file) I see formData is built up - but the php sees no postings. I have left in a further test in Go3 which has no file and works ok. And then you have Go4 which tries to include a file, and like Go2, fails. I can see in the dev-tools payload that a file, a test and an a is sent (albeit with a suspicious delay before the payload tab appears) - but the php sees/reflects none of this  What am I doing wrong here? Edit Notes:  it was suggested that this is similar to Set AJAX Content Type with plain JavaScript (No JQuery) but having tried all these options I can see that this does not solve things it was suggested that this is similar to Warning: Missing boundary in multipart/form-data POST data in Unknown on line 0 and although this has no marked solution - the most popular answers are adding a Content-Type in - which I have already covered and discounted as the problem  ",['https://i.sstatic.net/1TdITt3L.png']

The createStyleSheet function returns an object with many other functions that it creates, one of these functions are the createSelector, and, instead of declaring these functions with one argument, something like function createSelector<P>() {}, I want to receive it once in the main function createStyleSheet, so, instead of this: export function createStyleSheet<S extends StyleSheet>(stylesheet: S) {   function createSelector<P>() {}   function createSomething<P>() {}   function createAnotherThing<P>() {}   function createAnyThing<P>() {} }  I want this, where the argument P is optional: export function createStyleSheet<P, S extends StyleSheet>(stylesheet: S) {   function createSelector() {}   function createSomething() {}   function createAnotherThing() {}   function createAnyThing() {} }  Does it makes sense?

It seems problem caused by Global Scopes which I've overlooked. On our models we have boot functions as below for registering Global Scopes to service container I believe : // District Model protected static function boot() {     parent::boot();      static::addGlobalScope(new FilterBy('App\Services\V1\Area\DistrictFilters', request()->all())); }  Also below you can find FilterBy scope file codes : class FilterBy implements Scope {     protected $namespace;     protected $filters;      public function __construct($namespace, $filters)     {         $this->namespace = $namespace;         $this->filters = $filters;     }     /**      * Apply the scope to a given Eloquent query builder.      */     public function apply(Builder $builder, Model $model): void     {         $filter = new FilterBuilder($builder, $this->filters, $this->namespace);         $builder = $filter->apply();     } }  And also in FilterBuilder class we are applying filters as below : public function apply()     {         foreach ($this->filters as $name => $value) {             $normailizedName = ucfirst($name);             $class = $this->namespace . ""\\{$normailizedName}"";              if (! class_exists($class)) {                 continue;             }              if (strlen($value)) {                 (new $class($this->query))->handle($value);             } else {                 (new $class($this->query))->handle();             }         }          return $this->query;     }  And finally we have Name.php and CityId.php files inside the given App\Services\V1\Area\DistrictFilters namespace. They have handle methods inside them like below : public function handle($value = """"): void     {         // Name.php         $this->query->where('name', 'ilike','%'. $value .'%');     }  So If I understand it correctly, when I send PUT request to let's say DistrictController for example, because of these QueryFilters unless I send the 'Name' field as it's saved in database, it just can't find the model. For example I created a Distrcit record which has an Id with 974 as  below :  If I send a PUT request as below with same 'Name', it manages to find the Model and updates it : {     ""service_id"" : 1,     ""city_id"" : 1,     ""name"" : ""District"",     ""status"" : 1 }  But If i send the same request with updated name something like 'District 123' it can't find Model. So I updated the apply function inside FilterBy as below to prevent adding QueryFilters and this seems solved the problem : public function apply(Builder $builder, Model $model): void     {         if (collect(['PUT', 'PATCH'])->contains(request()->method())) {             return;         }                  $filter = new FilterBuilder($builder, $this->filters, $this->namespace);         $builder = $filter->apply();     }  It would be faster to find the problem if I have shared the whole District Model code. It's my bad. Thank you everyone for trying to help.

78403909,Chrome extension has no access to real or most up-to-date DOM element but same code works fine in the console. Does NOT seem to be a timing issue,"SITUATION I'm creating a Chrome extension to automatically fill out Zendesk's ticket forms. PROBLEM One of the things it does is insert text into a CKEditor on the page. However, CKEditor cannot be found on the DOM element by the extension. Strangely, the same exact code works perfectly fine when I run it in the console. NOT A TIMING ISSUE This does NOT seem to be a timing issue. I verified this in multiple ways, including:  Firstly, the action that looks for the CKEditor element only takes place when a button is clicked on. This is not a debug attempt but the way the extension should work by default. Adding very long 10s+ timeouts before the extension does anything at all, including adding the custom buttons to the UI. Running a test script that selected the element and kept logging it, which appear correctly, in the console every second or so and only then pressing the button. The console logs I added to the extension that run on button press then show an element that is almost identical to the one logged by the test script except it has no CKEditor. Screenshot below. Creating an ultra simplified extension, shown below.  I'VE ALSO TRIED  Asking ChatGPT to generate a manifest.json file with ALL possible permissions, running on ALL URLs. Fiddling with the manifest such as by changing when the script runs.  CODE Here's an ultra simplified version of the extension that replicates the issue. It works perfectly when ran in the console, always. function insertTicketReply() {     const element = document.querySelector('[data-test-id=""standalone-rich-text-ckeditor""]');      if (element.ckeditorInstance) {         console.log(""EDITOR FOUND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"");         element.ckeditorInstance.setData(""test"");     } else {         console.dir(element);     } }  setTimeout(insertTicketReply, 10000);  WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHEN RUNNING IN THE CONSOLE  WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHEN USING THE EXTENSION  NOTICE THE MISSING CKEDITOR IN THE ELEMENT  MANIFEST {   ""manifest_version"": 3,   ""name"": ""Happiness Hub - Zendesk"",   ""version"": ""1.0"",   ""description"": ""Automates filling out Zendesk tickets for strikingly.zendesk.com."",   ""permissions"": [     ""activeTab"",     ""storage"",     ""tabs""   ],   ""host_permissions"": [     ""<all_urls>""   ],   ""content_scripts"": [     {       ""matches"": [""https://strikingly.zendesk.com/*""],       ""js"": [""dist/content.js""],       ""run_at"": ""document_idle"",       ""all_frames"": true     }   ],   ""background"": {     ""service_worker"": ""src/background.js""   },   ""action"": {     ""default_popup"": ""src/popup.html"",     ""default_icon"": {       ""16"": ""icons/icon16.png"",       ""48"": ""icons/icon48.png"",       ""128"": ""icons/icon128.png""     }   },   ""icons"": {     ""16"": ""icons/icon16.png"",     ""48"": ""icons/icon48.png"",     ""128"": ""icons/icon128.png""   } }  ","['https://i.sstatic.net/A2TbHVz8.png', 'https://i.sstatic.net/f5KOuMr6.png', 'https://i.sstatic.net/62GPsABM.png']"

78362944,Wireshark HTTP2 Prior Knowledge HTTP Request not showing,"I ran into a problem and after trying a lot of different things, I didn't know where to turn and just decided to ask the problem here. I am experimenting with API Injection for a Cybersecurity Project and ran into a problem which I can not manage to fix on my own. As already mentioned in the topic, I am trying to capture traffic with wireshark and I was testing it out on a Python HTTP Server which I simply launched with python3 -m http.server. When I try requesting this HTTP Server, with curl (curl http://localhost:8000 (yes, the port is correct)), I get the request and the response in wireshark. (See picture 1 below). However when I try to request it with giving the flag --http2-prior-knowledge I can only see the response, and never the request. I am aware that the python server does not use http2 and that this causes an 50x error, however its weird that I see the response and not the request  (Response is packet 21.) (Dont mind the port 7777 traffic that comes from a 5g service that I am hosting over this VM). This is the response:  I dont get it. I see the request but not the response. I think that the reason is the http2 prior knowledge, but I want to know howI can actually see the request in the wireshark capture. I only see the 7777 Port activity (which is NRF for 5G), but not the request to 8000, which is where my http server is located. Help is very much appreciated and I hope the situation is understandable even though my frustration. EDIT: The original reason why I want to capture traffic is so that I can query an API Endpoint to get 5G Network Functions. The code I run in the cli is: curl -H ""Accept: application/json"" -X GET --http2-prior-knowledge 'http://127.0.0.10:7777/nnrf-nfm/v1/nf-instances' and I get back a response like: {""_links"":{""items"":[{""href"":""http://127.0.0.10:7777/nnrf-nfm/v1/nf-instances/d39729b0-fd9f-41ee-aea6-e94a977477e0""},{""h...

78293178,Why does VS Code Terminal have double parenthesys around the `((.venv) )`?,"When I start a new terminal (Terminal->New Terminal) the terminal propt is displayed as ((.venv) ) user@host:~$   Why does the terminal automatically start thinking the .venv is active?  which python3 produces /home/user/project/.venv/bin/python3  suggesting the venv is indeed active.  Why the double parenthesys? Why can't I deactivate this environment?  ((.venv) ) user@host:~/project$ deactivate bash: /home/user/.vscode-server/extensions/ms-python.python-2024.4.0/python_files/deactivate/bash/deactivate: Permission denied  Solution The problem is related to another issue with a ""project"" containing multiple virtual environments. (It does not matter where those venvs are.) A ""project"" is just the root directory opened by VS Code. With the Python extension installed, VS Code will auto-detect venvs anywhere within the project source tree. Normally the default behaviour is sensible:  If you have a single venv, it will be detected, and it will be set as the ""active workspace environment"" (which just means ""the default""). You can find this in the Python Extension ""Workspace Environments"" pane, which is accessed by clicking the Python button from the left hand sidebar.   However - if you have more than one virtual environment, or you do not want the virtual environment to always be active in the terminal by default, this behaviour should be turned off by changing the workspace environment to be the default ""Global Environment"" which is probably /bin/python3. With this change, opening a new terminal will not set a venv as active by default, and the terminal will not show (.venv). Note that it is impossible to deactivate a virtual environment in the terminal if the terminal is set such that when it opens a virtual environment is activated by default. This relates to the above described bug: If you do have a virtual environment active by default and then you try to activate another one, having found that you cannot deactivate the first one with the usual deactivate command, then the double parenthesis thing will show up like: ((.venv)) (.venv) $  Edit:  Note: VS Code may not automatically detect venvs. I thought it did but you might have to add them manually by running the Python: Select Interpreter command. (CTRL+SHIFT+P by default, or click the environment text in the right hand side of the status bar)  ",['https://i.sstatic.net/TMFFhusJ.png']

78277078,Why we have inconsistent warning on missing await inside a method body,"I was looking for a nasty bug after code refactoring (thank goodness our QA found a specific combination of circumstances to expose it) and figured out an await was missing. During investigation I suspected something like that in an early stage and run code inspection with Rider. I also checked for warnings to not have  warning CS4014: Because this call is not awaited, execution of the current method continues before the call is completed. Consider applying the 'await' operator to the result of the call.  However, to my surpise, it was actually the case. So, I started digging and figured out that when you call a method that returns a Task without async from a method that returns a task without async, you don't have the warning. Our code style is to avoid adding async/await when you only have 1 async call and pass through the results of the call further, hence, we had the problem. The test app I used is to highlight the issue. I understand we should have passed the result further up the chain, but this is why it is called ""a bug"". Plus, from my point of view, the calls should be treated the same. We use .NET Core 7. namespace ConsoleAppAsyncAwait {     internal class Program     {         static void Main(string[] args)         {                      }     }      public class AsyncTest     {         public Task CallerMethod1()         {             AwaitInside();              return Task.CompletedTask;         }          public Task CallerMethod2()         {             AsyncWithoutAwait();                          return Task.CompletedTask;         }          private Task AsyncWithoutAwait() => Delay(500);          private async Task AwaitInside() => await Delay(1000);          private async Task Delay(int milliseconds) => await Task.Delay(milliseconds);     } } ```  The build output: > Build started... 1>------ Build started: Project: ConsoleAppAsyncAwait, Configuration: Debug Any CPU ------ 1>C:\Projects\RandD\ConsoleAppAsyncAwait\Program.cs(15,13,15,26): warning CS4014: Because this call is not awaited, execution of the current method continues before the call is completed.

I basically have 3 branches, master, develop and qa. develop is branched off of master and qa from develop. When a feature comes I branch off of develop(e.g. Feature-branch-1), commit, send a PR and rebase and merge to develop. However, to deploy to qa, I send a PR from develop and rebase and merge to qa. The first time around it was ok. But, the second time I was doing this, I wasn't expecting merge conflicts. I believe I am not understanding some basic principles for this to work. Is this behaviour expected? What is the reason?

In my CSS, @media media queries that check the page's width for values below 980px never get activated because of this. How do I prevent this? Repro You'll observe this on any page, even a simple one with one line of text. To simulate a device, I'm using my browsers built in functionality. Both Chrome and Firefox have a similar feature, in Chrome it's called ""Device Toolbar"" and in Firefox it's called ""Responsive Design Mode"", both can be found in the Developer Tools menu.   In Firefox, before the issue shows itself, you also need to enable ""touch simulation"".  What you'll find is that when the viewport is wider than 980px, everything looks okay.

Here's how I'm thinking about it.  I refer to these docs for the cascading order. For ""1. Relevance"", both selectors match the <button> and thus don't get filtered out. For ""2. Origin and importance"", they're both the same. Both have an origin of ""author (developer)"" and an importance of ""normal"". For ""3. Specificity"", .bg-neutral-50 has a higher specificity than [type=button]. 0-1-0 vs 0-0-1. So then, .bg-neutral-50 should take precedence and have it's value for background-color applied.

When passed through the following SORT component configuration:  This results in the following output data:     Item_Number Material_Division_Number Source_ID Global Dimension 2 Code     905073 203020 2 203020   905073 203020 3 203020   905073 203020 4 203020   905073 203020 5 203020   905073 203020 6 203020   905073 203020 7 203020   905073 203020 8 203020   905073 203020 9 203020   905073 203020 10 203020     However, I have been unable to reproduce this behaviour in T-SQL, because it appears as though the SORT component first eliminates all columns but the ones selected for the sort key (Source_ID, Item_Number), and then re-joins back to the original dataset in order to include the columns marked as 'Pass Through' (Material_Division_Number, [Global Dimension 2 Code]), yet somehow excludes the singular row with the NULL value. Ultimately this takes an input data set of 34,434 rows and reduces it to an output set of 29,972 rows and I have to be able to account for how this is working.

77798028,OpenGL texture is black when being rendered inside imgui,"Using OpenGL 4.6 with OpenGL ES 3.2 (according to glxinfo -B) on Arch Linux. While using the official wiki snippet code for rendering an image as a texture in imgui, I ran into the issue of the image being rendered as a completely black texture. Here is my (slightly) modified helper function from the wiki that loads an image using STB and puts it into a texture. // Simple helper function to load an image into a OpenGL texture with common settings bool load_texture_from_file(const char* filename, GLuint* out_texture, unsigned char **out_raw_image,                              int* out_width, int* out_height, int* out_channels) {     unsigned char* image_data = stbi_load(filename, out_width, out_height, out_channels, 4);      if (image_data == NULL) {         printf(""Failed to load image: %s\n"", stbi_failure_reason());         return false;     }     // Create a OpenGL texture identifier     GLuint image_texture;     glGenTextures(1, &image_texture);     glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, image_texture);      // Setup filtering parameters for display     glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, GL_LINEAR);     glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER, GL_LINEAR);     glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S, GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE); // This is required on WebGL for non power-of-two textures     glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T, GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE); // Same      GLenum format;     if (*out_channels == 3)         format = GL_RGB;     else if (*out_channels == 4)         format = GL_RGBA;     else {         // Handle unsupported channel count         printf(""Unsupported number of channels: %d\n"", *out_channels);         stbi_image_free(image_data);         return false;     }     // Upload pixels into texture #if defined(GL_UNPACK_ROW_LENGTH) && !defined(__EMSCRIPTEN__)         glPixelStorei(GL_UNPACK_ROW_LENGTH, 0); #endif      glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, format, *out_width, *out_height, 0, format, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, image_data);      GLenum error = glGetError();     if (error != GL_NO_ERROR)     {         printf(""OpenGL error after glTexImage2D: %x\n"", error);         stbi_image_free(image_data);         return false;     }      *out_raw_image = image_data;     *out_texture = image_texture;     assert(image_texture != 0 && *out_texture != 0);     return true; }  I am somewhat convinced that my issue lies somewhere in how I'm handling converting the image to a texture so imgui can render it, because I am not getting any errors loading the image using stb_image.

The issue is that when navigating to a function definition in my code, which is defined in another file tab which is already open, a new Tab with the same content opens. Both tabs seem to be referencing the same file object. This means that changes made in one tab are also visible in the other, and vice versa. Here are some details and steps I have already taken:  I have reinstalled Visual Studio Code and set up a new project to ensure that the issue is not project-specific. All extensions have been temporarily disabled to rule out conflicts. The Visual Studio Code cache has been cleared, and the program has been restarted multiple times. I have changed and adapted the settings.json file. I do not know if this is helpful but here is the content of the file:  {     ""editor.codeActionsOnSave"": {},     ""python.analysis.extraPaths"": [],     ""python.autoComplete.extraPaths"": [],     ""python.condaPath"": ""C:\\Users\\...\\anaconda3\\Scripts\\conda-script.py"",     ""python.defaultInterpreterPath"": ""c:\\Users\\...\\anaconda3\\envs\\work\\python.exe"",     ""python.experiments.optInto"": [ ""pythonTerminalEnvVarActivation"" ],     ""python.pythonPath"": ""C:\\Users\\...\\anaconda3\\python.exe"",     ""python.terminal.activateEnvInCurrentTerminal"": true,     ""python.terminal.activateEnvironment"": true,     ""python.experiments.enabled"": true,     ""security.restrictUNCAccess"": false,     ""window.zoomLevel"": -1,     ""python.analysis.diagnosticSeverityOverrides"": { }  This behavior doesn't seem to align with the normal workflow of Visual Studio Code, and I am unsure how to further investigate or resolve it. Please provide guidance or recommendations on how to address this issue. As for extensions, I'm using the ones displayed in the attached image. However, since I'm collaborating on a group project, my group members use different extensions. Interestingly, they are also experiencing the same issue after pulling my latest version from GitHub. This is perplexing to me because the settings aren't part of the GitHub repository, and there are no hardcoded file paths in my code.  For a more detailed problem description, I've included additional images. In these images, you can observe that two excel_try files are open. The path of the first one shows as \\raven\Files\Maxi\GitHub\excel_try.py, and the path of the second one is V:\Maxi\GitHub\excel_try.py. Raven is an external network stored under the V: drive. Let me give an example: The function A is defined in the excel_try file. I am utilizing this function in the main_GUI file. However, when I attempt to view the definition of function A by clicking on it in main, Visual Studio directs me to the file located at \\raven\Files\Maxi\GitHub\excel_try.py. Yet, when I manually open the file from the project's file explorer, a different (or apparently the same) excel_try file located at V:\Maxi\GitHub\excel_try.py is displayed. I regret to inform you that my GitHub project is currently a work in progress and is not intended for public access at this time.

77755115,How to satisfy SonarLint java:S135 rule and keep code clean?,"SonarLint's rule java:S135 says:  Loops should not contain more than a single ""break"" or ""continue"" statement The use of break and continue statements increases the complexity of the control flow and makes it harder to understand the program logic. In order to keep a good program structure, they should not be applied more than once per loop. This rule reports an issue when there is more than one break or continue statement in a loop. The code should be refactored to increase readability if there is more than one.  And gives this example: for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {     // Noncompliant; two ""continue"" statements   if (i % 2 == 0) {     continue;   }    if (i % 3 == 0) {     continue;   }   // ... }  Should be refactored to: for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {   if (i % 2 == 0 || i % 3 == 0) {     continue;   }   // ... }  But it looks weird. I have this test example: @Slf4j public class TestService {      public int test(List<String> input) {         int count = 0;         for (String s : input) {             if (""ONE"".equals(s)) {                 log.info(""one was called"");                 processOne(s);                 continue;             }              String something = getSomethingBy(s);             if (something == null) {                 log.info(""something is null"");                 sendEmail();                 continue;             }              if (""TWO"".equals(s) && ""hz"".equals(something)) {                 process(s);                 count++;             }         }         return count;     }  and sonarLint claims:  If I change this code to: public int testGoodForSonarLint(List<String> input) {         int count = 0;         for (String s : input) {             if (""ONE"".equals(s)) {                 log.info(""one was called"");                 processOne(s);             } else {                 String something = getSomethingBy(s);                 if (something == null) {                     log.info(""something is null"");                     sendEmail();                 } else if (""TWO"".equals(s) && ""hz"".equals(something)) {                     process(s);                     count++;                 }             }         }         return count;     }  It looks so bad. I hate that if-else chin and hell of {}. The code looks like a Christmas tree. And it is with 2 continue. In real code, I have 4. So, it is not always possible to refactor as SonarLint suggests: if (i % 2 == 0 || i % 3 == 0) {         continue;       }  Because I need to do something in each condition, not just continue. Maybe I don't understand something but interapting cycle by continue or break looks much better and readable than brackets hell.

I should be able to set breakpoints on lines 75 and 78 but I cannot. I tried stopping the server, rerunning yarn install, and even deleting node_modules and restarting again. I also tried adding code and saving but it did not fix the issue. The browser refreshes for changes and loads the new code but still does not allow for breakpoints. When I run the code it skips those lines, despite them being in the sourcemap. So it's not registering the changes. I tried clearing the browser history, cache, and resetting chrome dev tools with no success. I also deleted the source project and recloned it only to get the same result. The strange thing is that although the latest code is refreshing in the browser and showing up in the sourcemap within the Chrome dev tools, the code is not executing, leading me to believe it's not detecting the changes.

77695363,"Returning array of strings in C++, length and corruption","I'm a .NET guy, diving into the realm of C++/micro-controller stuff. The following is a mockup of what I'm trying to do. I have a method which a value is passed in, and based on that value I want to return a different hard-coded array of strings. When I step through this, my function in main() seems to work, and it looks like I'm returning the proper type in the function. I can set a breakpoint and see files[0] is the expected string, files[1] is the expected string, etc. I can step through the loop and set a watch for files[i] and I see the appropriate string. All is good there. So two questions: How do I get how many elements are in the array? From reading a million posts, it seems like I'm not able to do this, right? Do I just need some end string (empty string, for example) that I need to check through as I loop through? Second, you'll notice I have the printf() commented out. When I had that enabled, after stepping through the printf(), it would change the contents of the string, and I don't understand why it's doing that. See images for the before/after of the step-through and the result of the watches. I thought it might be because the strings aren't implicitly terminated with a \0, but that had no effect. #include <cstdlib> #include <cstdio>  const char** GetSoundCategory(int category) {     const char* FILES1[3] = {         ""/myfile1.mp3"",         ""/this_is_my_file.mp3"",         ""/myfile9.mp3""     };      const char* FILES2[2] = {         ""/I love S.E.mp3"",          ""/please_help_me.mp3""     };         const char** ptr = nullptr;      switch (category)     {         case 1:             ptr = FILES1;             break;         case 2:             ptr = FILES2;             break;     }     return ptr; }  int main() {     const char** files = GetSoundCategory(2);     constexpr int number_of_files = 3;      for (int i = 0; i < number_of_files; i++)     {         //  printf(""%s\n"", files[i]);     } }  Before printf:  After printf:  ","['https://i.sstatic.net/4YQ66.png', 'https://i.sstatic.net/WqVc1.png']"

The problem now is that I cannot query the users data, as their userAccessToken is deeply nested: All top nodes from the API:  - First node and all first children expanded:  What possible solutions are there to get the data for that specific user only through the userAccessToken? I tried, indexing the DB, however this is was not possible because of the nesting and each user having a uniq identifier as first child. I could retrieve all data from the ""ACTIVITY-Activities"", and tried to do the filtering client side, this was due to performance not a solution (it did not finish after 30min).

77678151,Writing bytes in client less than expected,"I'm trying to use a UDP socket in C++ to send data between a client and server as a project in my university. The file I'm trying to send is an HTML document called s.html. It's 1,814,247 bytes in size. When the file is sent, I see two different numbers at the client, the first one is the total number of bytes received minus the size of the header of each packet - which is 8 bytes. It says that I received 1,814,239 bytes ""the number written at the right terminal"". So, there are 8 bytes that are missing in the receive from function.  The bigger issue is when I try to inspect the file size in its directory, it gives me 1,810,500 bytes, which is far away from the real number.

I'm using fluentvalidation on the server side. I have no problems with all the validations I use, but the notnull() validation does not give me the output I want. In short, when I get a validation error, the architecture I use catches the error with the middleware and allows me to return it the way I want. But when I use notnull, my middleware and verification codes do not activate. hence returning the default. Is this a mistake? here are the codes I used: ValidationAspect.cs: public class ValidationAspect : MethodInterception {     private Type _validatorType;     public ValidationAspect(Type validatorType)     {         if (!typeof(IValidator).IsAssignableFrom(validatorType))         {             throw new System.Exception(""Bu bir doğrulama sınıfı değil"");         }          _validatorType = validatorType;     }     protected override void OnBefore(IInvocation invocation)     {         var validator = (IValidator)Activator.CreateInstance(_validatorType);         var entityType = _validatorType.BaseType.GetGenericArguments()[0];         var entities = invocation.Arguments.Where(t => t.GetType() == entityType);         foreach (var entity in entities)         {             ValidationTool.Validate(validator, entity);         }     } }  ValidationTool.cs:  public class ValidationTool  {      public static void Validate(IValidator validator, object entity)      {          var context = new ValidationContext<Object>(entity);          var result = validator.Validate(context);           if (!result.IsValid)          {              throw new ValidationException(result.Errors);          }      }  }  ExceptionMiddleware.cs private Task HandleExceptionAsync(HttpContext httpContext, Exception e) {     httpContext.Response.ContentType = ""application/json"";     httpContext.Response.StatusCode = (int)HttpStatusCode.InternalServerError;      IEnumerable<ValidationFailure> errors;      if (e.GetType() == typeof(ValidationException))     {         httpContext.Response.StatusCode = (int)HttpStatusCode.BadRequest;          errors = ((ValidationException)e).Errors;          var errorPropertyDetail = new List<ErrorPropertyDetails>();          foreach (var error in errors)         {             var err = new ErrorPropertyDetails             {                 PropertyName = error.PropertyName,                 ErrorMessage = error.ErrorMessage,             };             errorPropertyDetail.Add(err);         }          return httpContext.Response.WriteAsync(new ValidationErrorDetail         {             Status = false,             Message = ""Validation Error"",             Errors = errorPropertyDetail         }.ToString());     }      if (e.GetType() == typeof(SecurityException))     {         httpContext.Response.StatusCode = (int)HttpStatusCode.Unauthorized;          return httpContext.Response.WriteAsync(new ErrorDetails         {             Status = false,             Message = ""Authentication Error"",         }.ToString());     }      return httpContext.Response.WriteAsync(new ErrorDetails     {         Status = false,         Message = ""Internal Server Error""     }.ToString()); }  When the request cannot pass validation, it comes here as ValidationException.

It worked both when i wanted to execute part of the code as well as when cursor was simply in the line that interested me. However, very recently I've noticed that the same shortcut jumps to the next fragment of code, which I REALLY hate. I'd appreciate any tips on how to disable jumping to the next line when executing lines.  I've figured that it might be related to the keybinding in settings, so I've deleted all of them but the highlighted one - still jumps to next line. When I delete highlited line, it stops working altohether. I'm not use how to remove ""jump to next line after execution"" behaviour. I've tried using custom macro ""macros"": {     ""pythonRunCurrentLineAndStay"": [         ""python.execSelectionInTerminal"",         ""cursorUp"",         ""cursorUp"",         ""cursorUp"",     ] }  but the jump to next part of the code happens after execution of macro, so the end effect is the same.

When I change Pizza pizza = null; to Pizza pizza;, underline disappear. Please help me, thanks in advance! Edit: The purpose of question to find the reason why intellij do it like that. Maybe it is too easy, but sometime, there are many easy things we don't know. First, I think, it is error on my code, there are some questions on my mind, like: why we don't need initilize value of varible, and what is the function of underline? Second, As i said, I spend hours to find the answer, I have found the posts, maybe its problem like my post, but when I read all the answer, I'm still confusing, because I think, its not problem to intellij do it like, yeah, the firsh though. Maybe, it represent other things, I really know what it is. That's reason. I posted my question. So, I hope the community understand the confuse on my mind, its simple if we have much experient with java and intellij Anyway, Thanks to explain for me. The problem is only variable was changed on method like @Jorn answered Update: I want to delete this question, how can I delete it?, I read I've thought better of my question; can I delete it? many times, but I'm confused about the steps to delete it.

77161253,How to select for content contains substring in Windows Event Viewer using XPath 1.0?,"Windows Event Viewer (WEV) allows custom queries using ""a subset of XPath 1.0.""1  I've been unsuccessfully struggling for a couple hours to craft a query that works. I'm hoping someone on the stack knows XPath 1.0 better than I...  At this point I'm not sure if the XPath ""subset"" WEV accepts doesn't accept contains(), or if I'm just not crafting a valid query.  (I am very n00b at XPath.) What I think should work is *[EventData[Data[contains(text(),""foo""]]] or *[Event[contains(Data, ""foo"")]].  The intent is to select every node that has an EventData element that has a Data element that contains the substring ""foo"" in its text content. FWIW, the query *[EventData[Data]] does select every node that has an EventData element that has a Data element.  I just need to narrow the 30,622 results down to the 7 that I know contain ""foo"". Edit @gilles-quénot was unclear on what I'm asking, so here are step by step how to reproduce and expected output:  Open Windows Event Viewer (%windir%\system32\eventvwr.msc /s)  Open the System logs     Click on Create Custom View... (on right side of window), select the XML tab, and enable Edit query manually.    Change the query to:  <QueryList>   <Query Id=""0"" Path=""System"">     <Select Path=""System"">*[EventData[Data[@Name=""updateTitle""]]]</Select>   </Query> </QueryList>   Click the OK button twice, and you should have selected a couple hundred to a couple thousand events depending on how many updates your system has had.  Here is an example event:    Edit the filter to change the Select element to <Select Path=""System"">*[EventData[contains(Data, ""Intelligence Update"")]]</Select>, click OK twice and you should get this error message:   No messages are selected. Edit 2 I found a link that documents WEV's XPath 1.0 limitations.  Unfortunately, I find the documentation a little ambiguous.  On the one hand it says ""Any valid XPath expression is acceptable if the location paths conform to the following restrictions.""  In those restrictions it does not say the XPath 1.0 functions are not supported, and it explicitly says the position function, band function, and timediff functions are supported. On the other hand, it definitely seems WEV does not accept a valid XPath 1.0 query (e.g. ""*[EventData[Data[contains(., ""Intelligence Update"")]]]), so the implications is that WEV does not support any of the XPath 1.0 functions except the three mentioned in the restrictions. Comment on possible duplicates This question was marked as a duplicate, but it doesn't overlap with any of the questions that were proposed as duplicates. My query is specifically for Windows Event Viewer which uses XPath 1.0 syntax as part of its filter implementation. It is probable that future users of Windows Event Viewer will have this question and might not find it if this question is closed, because the others do not reference WEV.

77073556,Prototypes chain differences between Firefox and Chrome console,"When we try to log a custom prototypes chain, made with custom constructor functions, the Chrome console will display it in a very illogical way.

What is even more intriguing is that it is not happening with the built-in constructors (Array, Function, Number, etc...). When we use a simple array, we can clearly see its prototype, logically presented. Even though built-in constructors inherit from Object too, they do also have a prototypes chain.   console.log([1,2,3])     The above looks perfectly understandable, we can literally open each of the link of the prototype chain with its corresponding name. To finish, I want to point out that Firefox decided to take another path and to always show it in a logical way, built-in and non built-in constructors.  ■ So, why is Chrome doing this ? And why doing this especially with the custom constructors function and not the built-in ones ?

Something similar like this:  About line 12, it gets a little less visible, and it proceeds to the last line it is barely visisble. The best I could do, is to set the opacity on the lines (0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2), but it is not seamless, because the horizontal lines (the difference in opacity between the elements) can be seen (it is barely visible on the picture, but it is definitely more visible on the screen):  ","['https://i.sstatic.net/bFWjb.png', 'https://i.sstatic.net/xawri.png']"

There is a need to, basically, see the state of three tasks in Task Scheduler Library running on the same box. The author of those tasks I have credentials to. Then, the desire is to enable or disable at will. My first approach is to write PowerShell scripts that can be called from the ASP.NET site. Running as Windows PowerShell ISE as Administrator on the box, I have a script that provides the desired output: # https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1313673/execute-powershell-as-an-administrator-from-c-sharp Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted  # https://blog.danskingdom.com/Run-PowerShell-as-another-user/ $securePassword = ConvertTo-SecureString ""*******"" -AsPlainText -force  $credential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PsCredential(""domain\username"",$securePassword) # After specifying your credentials, you can then use them in your call to create a New-PSSession using the PowerShell script below. $s = New-PSSession -credential $credential -ComputerName localhost  Enter-PSSession -Session $s  # https://bobcares.com/blog/manage-scheduled-tasks-with-powershell/ $results= Get-ScheduledTask | Where-Object {$_.TaskPath -eq ""\""} | Where-Object { $_.TaskName -like ""STAGE_DEMO_*""} Exit-PSSession  Write-Output $results  Now my Page_Load comes from the accepted answer to this question: Binding output from powershell script to gridview in asp.net c# protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) {     this.UnobtrusiveValidationMode = System.Web.UI.UnobtrusiveValidationMode.None;              // Initialize PowerShell engine     var shell = PowerShell.Create();      // Add the script to the PowerShell object     string rootPath = Server.MapPath(""~"");      var scriptPath = rootPath + @""\Scripts\PowerShell\*****.ps1"";     shell.Commands.AddCommand(scriptPath);      try     {         var results = shell.Invoke();     }     catch (Exception exception)     {         Console.WriteLine(exception.Message);     } }  Executing, I do not get usable output:  In my case, the actual credentials are validated, since they work in the ISE, running as Administrator. However, if I replaced my script with this one: write-output @(     (new-object PSCustomObject -Property ([ordered] @{          ""MyProperty1"" = ""MyValue1.1""          ""MyProperty2"" = ""MyValue2.1""          ""MyProperty3"" = ""MyValue3.1""     })),     (new-object PSCustomObject -Property ([ordered] @{           ""MyProperty1"" = ""MyValue1.2""           ""MyProperty2"" = ""MyValue2.2""           ""MyProperty3"" = ""MyValue3.2""     })) );  I get very nice results I can see working with:  So, I am convinced I am running into an issue with at least one of these things:  My script itself in some way I do not see.

I have no idea where it is - where is it?  Thirdly, if I pull an image down using Docker Desktop, where does it store the image/files locally? If I run this command in the CLI, do I need to be in a DOS/PS prompt, or do I need to run it from within the WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) shell? And what directory should I be in when I run it?  Fourthly, where is the compose.yaml file located?  Fifthly, do Docker project folders need to be located somewhere specifically relative to the Docker Desktop application itself for docker commands to work properly, or can I create Docker project folders anywhere that suits my folder management scheme?

Neither of these components are related to firebase services. However, I'm getting an error as shown below. Due to this error, the test I want to run is unfortunately not working(Compilation failed for test). What could be the reason? any idea? Furthermore, if I directly write the enum and its extension into the test file instead of importing them, and then remove the imports, I can run the test file without encountering any errors. However, even though the imported files don't contains any export lines, why might I still be receiving an unrelated error?  ",['https://i.sstatic.net/p6QW8.png']

76827940,Debugging into library code from VSCode Jupyter,"I'm using VS Code + Jupyter Notebooks to develop ML-based things in python. I can successfully place breakpoints inside the notebook cells, but weirdly enough, if I try to step into a function that isn't defined there, it steps over it. Example:  In this cell I am debugging a function called run() which calls model.generate(...), which in turns calls a callback function filter_allowed_tokens defined in a different cell. In this breakpoint, I am inside filter_allowed_tokens(), and according to the call stack (bottom left of screenshot), the frame below is run(), even though, clearly, there should be a generate() frame in the middle. This is consistent with the fact that I am unable to step into it. This call stack is very weird and I have a hard time explaining it to myself. Is there a setting that causes ""full call stacks"", and hopefully I will be able to step into the library code that is called from the notebook's cells? If it has any effect, I am running on windows using WSL. If I take all of my notebook's code and paste it into a normal python file, the step into will work as expected.

76752949,Shouldn't this give me dangling reference errors?,"I'm returning to C++ after about a decade of other programming languages so bear with me here. The following program compiles for me in a C++20 project in CLion: #include <iostream>  using namespace std;  class MyClass { private: public:     MyClass() {         cout << ""MyClass constructor"" << endl;     }     MyClass(const MyClass& myClass) {         cout << ""MyClass copy constructor"" << endl;     }      MyClass& operator=(const MyClass& myClass) {         cout << ""MyClass operator="" << endl;         return *this;     }     friend std::ostream& operator<< (std::ostream& os, const MyClass &myClass){         return os << ""MyClass stringifier"";     }     ~MyClass(){         cout << ""MyClass destructor"" << endl;     } };  MyClass& f(){     cout << ""f() entered"" << endl;     MyClass x;     return x; }  MyClass* g(){     cout << ""g() entered"" << endl;     MyClass x;     return &x; }  int main() {     cout << ""main() entered"" << endl;     MyClass& a = f();     cout << ""f() exited"" << endl;     cout << a << endl;     MyClass* b= g();     cout << ""g() exited"" << endl;     cout << *b << endl; }  and the output is: main() entered f() entered MyClass constructor MyClass destructor f() exited MyClass stringifier g() entered MyClass constructor MyClass destructor g() exited MyClass stringifier  Now, when I hover over the return statements, CLion does give me some warnings:   It might be interesting to note that this now quite old article mentions that the scenario generated by function f() is ""not valid"" C++. Yet my compiler seems to disagree. I am surprised that this program compiles and runs without issue. Should I not be getting a ""dangling reference"" error at runtime where I try to print a and *b? I don't think that this falls under Return Value Optimization / Copy Elision since I am not returning a new instance of MyClass anywhere: the copy constructor is clearly not called anywhere since we can't see its printing side effect. // Edit: The accepted answer to this SO post, posted in 2011, also seems to suggest that what f does here should not work.
